# Ancient Coins Constitution

> **This document is the non-negotiable contract for how this project is built.**
> Every AI agent session must read this file first. Every PR must comply.
> Deviations require an explicit, documented waiver (ADR) under §22.

**Project**: Ancient Coins (self-hosted personal collection PWA)
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Ratified**: 2026-04-28
**Last Amended**: 2026-05-28

## §0. Hierarchy of Authority

When two artifacts conflict, the higher-authority document wins. Lower-authority
artifacts MUST be updated to match within the same PR, or the conflict MUST be
escalated to amend the higher artifact (see §22).

Ordered list of governing artifacts, highest authority first:

1. **This Constitution** — `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
2. **Product Requirements** — `docs/prd.md`
3. **Active Feature Spec** — `specs/NNN-*/spec.md`
4. **Active Implementation Plan** — `specs/NNN-*/plan.md`
5. **Active Task List** — `specs/NNN-*/tasks.md`
6. **Backlog Card** — `specs/_backlog/F0NN-*.md`
7. **Project Decisions Ledger** — `.squad/decisions.md`
8. **Agent Judgment** (lowest) — MUST be voiced in the PR description or in
   `.squad/decisions/inbox/`; never silently assumed.

If a lower document contradicts a higher one, stop and raise it through the
Amendment Process (§22) or — for non-constitutional artifacts — via
`.squad/decisions/inbox/`.

## Core Principles

### I. Layered Architecture (Go API)

The Go API MUST follow a strict four-layer architecture:

```
Handler → Service → Repository → Database
```

- **Handlers** are thin: parse the request, call a service or repository,
  return the response. Handlers MUST NOT contain business logic or raw SQL.
- **Services** contain all business logic. Services MUST be HTTP-agnostic
  and MUST NOT reference `gin.Context` or any HTTP framework type.
- **Repositories** own all database access. Every GORM query MUST live in
  `src/api/repository/`. Repositories MUST use GORM scopes from
  `repository/scopes.go` instead of repeating `.Where()` clauses.
- **Models** (`src/api/models/`) MUST import only the Go standard library.
- Multi-step writes MUST use transactions (`r.db.Transaction()`).
- Internal errors MUST NOT leak to clients. Log server-side; return
  generic messages to the caller.

**Rationale**: Enforced layer separation prevents coupling, enables
independent testing of each layer, and keeps the codebase navigable as
feature count grows.

### II. Dependency Injection

All packages MUST receive dependencies via constructor injection
(`NewXxxHandler(repo, service)` pattern).

- **Only `main.go` may import the `database` package.** Every other
  package receives `*gorm.DB` or a repository/service interface through
  its constructor.
- DI wiring order in `main.go`: `config.Load()` → `database.Connect()`
  → construct repos → construct services → construct handlers → register
  routes.
- Three route groups exist: `api` (public auth), `protected`
  (JWT required), `admin` (JWT + admin role).

**Rationale**: Constructor injection makes dependencies explicit, enables
test doubles, and prevents hidden global state.

### III. Service Boundary Separation

The system is composed of three independently deployable services. Each
service MUST respect strict boundary rules:

| Service | Runtime | Responsibilities |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Go API | Go 1.26.1 / Gin | REST API, auth, data persistence, SSE proxy |
| Vue SPA | Browser | UI, state management, PWA shell |
| Python Agent | Python 3.12 / FastAPI | AI inference, LangGraph pipelines |

- The **Go API MUST contain zero LLM or agent logic**. All AI inference
  MUST be proxied to the Python agent service via `services/agent_proxy.go`.
- The **Python agent is stateless** — it MUST NOT access the database
  directly. All context (API keys, user data, prompts) MUST be passed
  per-request from the Go API.
- The **Vue SPA** communicates with the Go API exclusively via REST
  (`/api/*`). It MUST NOT call the Python agent directly.
- SSE streams flow Python → Go → Vue (Go proxies the byte stream).

**Rationale**: Hard service boundaries prevent accidental coupling
between AI logic and business logic, allow independent scaling, and
keep each codebase in its native language ecosystem.

### IV. Strict Typing & Build Parity

All code MUST pass the strictest available type checking for its
language, and local builds MUST match CI/Docker builds:

- **Go**: `go vet ./...` MUST pass with zero warnings.
- **TypeScript/Vue**: Docker builds use `vue-tsc --build`, which is
  stricter than local `vue-tsc --noEmit`. All code MUST pass the Docker
  check. Use `?.` (optional chaining) and `?? ''` / `?? 0` (nullish
  coalescing) for nullable props passed to non-nullable children.
- **Python**: `ruff check app/ tests/` MUST pass. All request/response
  schemas MUST use Pydantic models (`app/models/`).

**Rationale**: Type strictness catches bugs before runtime, and build
parity eliminates "works on my machine" failures.

### V. Design Token System

The Vue frontend MUST use the design token system defined in
`variables.css` and global classes in `main.css`. Raw values MUST NOT
be hardcoded when a token exists.

- **Never hardcode** `border-radius`, colors, spacing, or font sizes.
- **Never duplicate** chip or button CSS — use global classes (`.chip`,
  `.chip-sm`, `.badge`, `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, etc.).
- **Never invent** a new font size — pick from the typography scale
  (Cinzel for headings, Inter for body).
- **Gold (`--accent-gold`)** is reserved for: active states,
  values/prices, links, and section accents.
- All uppercase labels MUST use `letter-spacing: 0.08em`.

**Rationale**: A strict token system ensures visual consistency,
prevents design drift, and enables theme changes from a single file.

### VI. AI/Agent Isolation

All AI agent pipelines MUST follow these rules:

- Search agents MUST pass only tool-returned data downstream — never
  invented details.
- Verification agents MUST confirm every URL is live and every date is
  in the future.
- All worker agent outputs MUST conform to a defined Pydantic schema —
  no free-form text.
- The top-level supervisor (`app/supervisor.py`) MUST enforce a max
  iteration count to prevent infinite loops.
- Anthropic web search MUST use `get_search_model()` from
  `app/llm/provider.py` (which calls `bind_tools`). Use
  `get_chat_model()` for nodes that do not search.

**Rationale**: AI output is non-deterministic. Schema enforcement and
data provenance rules ensure the rest of the system can trust agent
results.

### VII. Schema-Driven Contracts

Every external-facing interface MUST have an explicit schema:

- **Go API**: Swagger annotations on all public handler methods.
- **Python Agent**: Pydantic models for all request/response payloads.
- **Vue SPA**: All API calls go through `src/web/src/api/client.ts`
  (Axios with JWT interceptor and 401 refresh queue).
  `sanitizeCoin()` normalizes `''`/`undefined` → `null` before sending.

**Rationale**: Explicit schemas are the single source of truth for
inter-service communication and enable automated validation.

### VIII. Conventional Commits & Workflow

All commits MUST use conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
`refactor:`, `chore:`.

- AI-assisted commits MUST include the co-author trailer:
  `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`
- Build automation uses Taskfile (`task --list` for all targets).
- Multi-stage Docker builds produce two containers: Go+Vue (app) and
  Python (agent), orchestrated via `docker-compose.yaml`.

**Rationale**: Conventional commits enable automated changelogs and
semantic versioning. Standardized build tooling reduces onboarding
friction.

### IX. UI/UX Consistency

- No emojis in UI text, prompts, or AI responses.
- Dark theme is the default.
- The app MUST be PWA-compatible — test on mobile viewports.
- Icons MUST use `lucide-vue-next`.
- Agent chat streaming uses `fetch` + manual SSE parsing, not Axios.
- CSS variables: `--accent-gold`, `--bg-card`, `--border-subtle`,
  `--text-primary` (see Design Token System for full list).

**Rationale**: Consistent UI rules prevent visual fragmentation across
features and ensure the app feels cohesive on all devices.

### X. Architecture Enforcement

Architecture rules MUST be enforced by automated tests:

- `architecture_test.go` validates package import rules at build time.
- Package import constraints:

| Package | May Import |
|---------|-----------|
| `handlers/` | `services/`, `repository/`, `models/` |
| `services/` | `repository/`, `models/` |
| `repository/` | `models/`, `gorm.io/gorm` |
| `models/` | Standard library only |
| `middleware/` | `models/`, `gorm.io/gorm` |

- `go test ./...` MUST pass before any PR is merged.
- `ruff check` and `pytest` MUST pass for agent changes.

**Rationale**: Automated enforcement catches violations at commit time,
not during code review. Rules that are only documented but not enforced
will eventually be violated.

### XI. Security Hardening

All services MUST follow these security baselines:

- **CORS**: MUST whitelist specific origins. `AllowOriginFunc` MUST NOT
  return `true` for all origins. Production MUST list only the
  application domain.
- **Input validation**: User-supplied values used in SQL MUST be
  parameterized or validated against a whitelist. GORM scopes are
  preferred over raw queries.
- **Upload validation**: File uploads MUST validate extension against an
  allowlist (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) and check MIME
  type from magic bytes, not just `Content-Type`.
- **Rate limiting**: Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/*`) MUST be rate-limited
  to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Body size limits**: `MaxMultipartMemory` and JSON body size MUST be
  capped (recommended: 10 MB for multipart, 1 MB for JSON).
- **Error responses**: Internal error details MUST NOT leak to clients.
  Log server-side; return generic messages.
- **Containers**: Production Docker images MUST run as non-root users.

**Rationale**: Security defaults prevent common attack vectors (XSS,
CSRF, injection, DoS) and reduce the blast radius of vulnerabilities.
Source: `docs/security-analysis.md`.

### XII. Authentication & Token Policy

The application uses a multi-method auth stack. Each method MUST follow
these rules:

- **JWT access tokens**: 15-minute expiry. Signed with `JWT_SECRET`
  environment variable. The application SHOULD refuse to start if
  `JWT_SECRET` is unset or below minimum entropy in production.
- **Refresh tokens**: 30-day rolling lifetime. Format: `rt_` prefix +
  32 random hex bytes. Server stores SHA-256 hash only. Old refresh
  tokens MUST be revoked on each refresh (one-time use).
- **Client token storage**: `localStorage` on the frontend. The axios
  interceptor handles 401 → refresh → replay automatically with a
  concurrent-request queue.
- **WebAuthn/FIDO2**: Platform authenticators only (Face ID, Touch ID,
  fingerprint). `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` and `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` MUST be set
  for production. WebAuthn challenge sessions MUST have a TTL
  (recommended: 5 minutes) to prevent memory leaks.
- **API keys**: Used for programmatic access. Keys MUST be stored hashed
  and MUST be revocable.
- **First user**: The first registered user is auto-assigned admin role.

**Rationale**: Explicit token policies prevent silent security
degradation and ensure consistent auth behavior across deployments.
Source: `docs/authentication.md`.

### XIII. PWA / Mobile Interaction Rules

The application MUST maintain two distinct UI modes:

- **PWA/mobile mode** (`display-mode: standalone`):
  - Hamburger menu with popover for filters, sort, navigation, and
    logout.
  - Default gallery view is swipe carousel (315 × 399 px cards).
  - Pull-to-refresh on gallery when scrolled to top.
  - Camera capture button on image uploads (rear camera).
  - "My Collection" title hidden for compact header.
  - No page-level pagination in swipe mode.
  - NO sticky positioning on detail page images or action bars.
- **Desktop mode** (standard browser):
  - Inline toolbar with filters, sort, and view controls.
  - Default gallery view is grid.
  - Sticky image sidebar and sticky action bar on detail pages.
  - Full pagination visible.

- Offline: Service worker caches static assets. API calls require
  network. The app shell MUST load without connectivity.
- Settings (default view, sort) persist in `localStorage`.
- Desktop layout changes MUST NOT break PWA layout. Use
  `@media (min-width: 769px)` for desktop-only CSS.

**Rationale**: PWA and desktop are the two primary consumption modes.
Regressions in either degrade user experience significantly.
Source: `docs/pwa-guide.md`.

### XIV. Social & Privacy Model

Social features MUST enforce these rules:

- **Follow workflow**: pending → accepted / blocked. Only accepted
  followers can view a user's gallery.
- **Blocked users**: Cannot re-request until explicitly unblocked.
- **Public/private profiles**: Only `isPublic=true` users appear in
  search and can receive follow requests. Setting a profile to private
  PERMANENTLY DELETES all existing followers (destructive action).
- **Private coins**: Individual coins marked `isPrivate` are hidden from
  all followers, even accepted ones.
- **Gallery access**: Read-only. Limited to images and essential details.
  Pricing/value and AI analysis MUST NOT be shown to followers.
- **Comments & ratings**: Accepted followers can comment and rate (1–5
  stars). Both commenter and coin owner can delete comments.
- **Avatars**: Locally uploaded images (no Gravatar dependency). Default
  avatar is the Ed-Mar coin logo.

**Rationale**: Privacy and access control are critical for a personal
collection app. These rules prevent data leakage and give users control.
Source: `docs/social-feature.md`.

### XV. Supply Chain & CI Integrity

- GitHub Actions MUST pin action versions by SHA, not mutable tags.
- Docker base images SHOULD pin to specific digests for production
  builds.
- Branch protection MUST be enabled on `main` (require PR reviews,
  require status checks to pass).
- Dependency updates SHOULD be automated (Dependabot or equivalent).

**Rationale**: Supply chain attacks are a growing vector. Pinning and
branch protection prevent unauthorized code from reaching production.
Source: `docs/security-analysis.md`.

### XVI. Account Lifecycle

- **Email**: Required for all new registrations. Legacy users without
  email see a dismissible modal (7-day snooze via `localStorage`).
  `GET /auth/me` includes `emailMissing` flag.
- **Registration**: Username + password + email. Validated format.
- **Admin**: First registered user auto-assigned admin role.
- **Profile deletion**: Setting `isPublic=false` permanently deletes
  followers (see Social & Privacy Model).

**Rationale**: Clear account lifecycle rules prevent edge cases around
legacy data and ensure consistent onboarding.
Source: `docs/authentication.md`, `docs/social-feature.md`.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Path |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| Backend | Go, Gin, GORM, SQLite | Go 1.26.1 | `src/api/` |
| Frontend | Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia, Vite, PWA | Vue 3 | `src/web/` |
| Agent | Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain | Python 3.12 | `src/agent/` |
| Build | Multi-stage Docker, Taskfile | — | `Dockerfile`, `src/agent/Dockerfile` |
| Database | SQLite (pure-Go driver) | — | Runtime volume |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens) | — | `src/api/middleware/` |

- Settings use key-value `AppSetting` model; constants and defaults
  live in `services/settings_service.go`.
- Sentinel errors in services (e.g., `ErrNotFound`,
  `ErrInvalidCredentials`).
- First registered user is auto-assigned admin role.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New API Feature

1. Model in `src/api/models/` → add to `AutoMigrate` in
   `database/database.go`.
2. Repository in `src/api/repository/*_repository.go`.
3. Service (if business logic needed) in `src/api/services/*_service.go`.
4. Thin handler in `src/api/handlers/` with `NewXxxHandler()` constructor.
5. Wire in `src/api/main.go` (create repo → service → handler, register
   routes under correct group).
6. Run `go test ./...` to verify architecture rules pass.

### Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Go API (from src/api/)
go build ./...               # compile
go vet ./...                 # lint
go test -v ./...             # all tests

# Vue frontend (from src/web/)
npm run build                # production build (type-check + vite)

# Python agent (from src/agent/)
ruff check app/ tests/       # lint
pytest tests/ -v             # all tests

# Task runner (from repo root)
task build                   # build API + web
task test                    # Go tests
task up-all                  # all dev servers
```

## §17. Quality Gate

Every PR MUST pass the following checklist before merge. Items marked
"Phase 3" are not yet configured in CI — they become blocking when the
relevant tooling lands.

- [ ] `go vet ./...` clean
- [ ] `go test ./...` green (includes `architecture_test.go` from
      Principle X)
- [ ] `vue-tsc --build` clean (Docker-equivalent strictness — see
      Principle IV)
- [ ] `npm run build` green
- [ ] `ruff check app/ tests/` clean (when agent code is touched)
- [ ] `pytest tests/ -v` green (when agent code is touched)
- [ ] `gitleaks` scan clean *(Phase 3 — once `.gitleaks.toml` lands)*
- [ ] `trivy` container scan: no High/Critical
      *(Phase 3 — once `security-scan.yml` lands)*
- [ ] Conventional Commits format (see Principle VIII)
- [ ] `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`
      trailer present when AI-assisted
- [ ] Constitution self-check noted in PR description — cite the
      relevant Principle or section
- [ ] Definition of Done checklist (§21) checked in the PR

**Signed commits are NOT required.** This is a single-developer hobby
project; the Conventional Commits format and Co-authored-by trailer are
the workflow signals we rely on.

## §18. AI Agent Operating Rules

### 18.1 Always

- Read this constitution at session start.
- Check `.squad/decisions.md` for recent project-wide decisions.
- Check the active feature spec (`specs/NNN-*/spec.md`,
  `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before writing code.
- Read your own agent charter (`.squad/agents/<name>/charter.md`) and
  recent `history.md` entries.
- Check `.copilot/skills/` for any skill that matches the task.
- Cite this constitution by Principle or section when making a design
  decision.
- Run the full Quality Gate (§17) before declaring a task done.

### 18.2 Never

- Invent facts, file paths, package names, APIs, or library symbols.
  When uncertain, read the file or run a search.
- Modify locked files: agent charters (`.squad/agents/*/charter.md`),
  append-only logs retroactively (`.squad/log/**`,
  `.squad/agents/*/history.md`, `.squad/decisions.md`,
  `.squad/orchestration-log/**`).
- Bypass a reviewer rejection (Strict Lockout — see
  `.squad/agents/brutus/charter.md`). A rejected PR is rejected until
  the reviewer explicitly clears it.
- Disable lint rules, weaken tests, or use `any` / `@ts-ignore` /
  `nolint` without an inline justification comment.
- Commit secrets, `.env` files, or generated build artifacts.

### 18.3 Context Discipline

- Load only the files needed for the current task. Reference larger
  documents by path; do not paste their contents into chat unless
  required.
- Record cross-cutting decisions in `.squad/decisions/inbox/`, not in
  chat replies that will be lost.
- One feature per session — do not juggle multiple specs.
- Prefer `grep` / `glob` over reading whole files when looking for a
  symbol.

### 18.4 Drift Recovery

If work begins to diverge from the active spec:

1. **Stop** — do not silently re-scope.
2. Commit any working code as a WIP commit on the feature branch.
3. Write a current-state note to `.squad/decisions/inbox/` describing
   the drift and your proposed adjustment.
4. Wait for Lead (Maximus) acknowledgment before continuing.

### 18.5 Session Handoff

Session handoff is owned by **Scribe** via `.squad/log/` and per-agent
`.squad/agents/<name>/history.md`. Agents MUST NOT introduce
`SESSION-NOTES.md`, `.copilot-state.md`, or any other flat session-log
file — that pattern is explicitly superseded by the Squad ceremony
system documented in `.squad/ceremonies.md`.

## §19. Documentation Requirements

The following documents constitute the canonical documentation surface.
✅ exists today; ⏳ Phase 3 = scheduled deliverable, not yet present.

| Document | Path | Status | Owner |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Product Requirements (PRD) | `docs/prd.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 | Lead |
| Architecture overview | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | ✅ exists | Lead |
| Software Design Document | `docs/SDD.md` | ✅ exists | Lead |
| Architecture Decision Records | `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 | Lead |
| Threat model (STRIDE) | `docs/threat-model.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 (split from `security-analysis.md`) | Lead |
| Security baseline / controls catalog | `docs/security-baseline.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 (split from `security-analysis.md`) | Lead |
| API reference | `docs/api-reference.md` + root `openapi.yaml` | ✅ exists; ⏳ root `openapi.yaml` Phase 3 | Backend |
| Authentication design | `docs/authentication.md` | ✅ exists | Backend |
| Deployment runbook | `docs/deployment.md` | ✅ exists | Lead |
| Getting started / onboarding | `docs/getting-started.md` | ✅ exists | Lead |
| Feature surface | `docs/features.md` | ✅ exists | Product |
| Testing strategy | `docs/testing.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 (extracted from copilot-instructions) | Lead |
| References / prior art | `docs/references.md` | ⏳ Phase 3 | Lead |
| Changelog | `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | ✅ exists | Lead |
| Operational runbooks | `docs/runbooks/` | ⏳ Phase 3 stretch | Lead |

ADRs use the Nygard format (Context / Decision / Status / Consequences).
ADR `0001` will retroactively record this constitution as the governing
contract when Phase 3 begins.

## §20. Audit & Continuous Improvement

### 20.1 Cadence

- **Weekly**: run `/audit` (the `speckit.analyze` prompt). Maximus
  drives the analysis; Brutus reviews findings. File issues for any
  High/Critical drift between constitution and code.
- **Per-release**: regenerate SBOM, re-review the threat model.
- **Quarterly**: PRD review — verify what we are building still matches
  the documented product intent.
- **Annually**: full dependency major-version review and restore drill.

### 20.2 Artifacts

- Audit reports are appended to `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  (create the folder when the first audit runs).
- ADRs are preserved indefinitely in `docs/adr/`.
- Squad ceremony logs in `.squad/log/` provide institutional memory.

## §21. Definition of Done

A task is **done** only when every item below is true. Mirror this
checklist in the PR description.

1. **Code compiles**: `go build ./...`, `npm run build`, and
   `pip install -e ".[dev]"` succeed.
2. **Architecture tests green**: `go test -run TestArchitecture ./...`
   passes (Principle X).
3. **Unit tests pass**: `go test ./...` and `pytest tests/` pass for
   any touched module.
4. **Type checks pass**: `vue-tsc --build` and Go's compiler are clean
   (Principle IV).
5. **Linters clean**: `go vet ./...` and `ruff check app/ tests/` are
   clean.
6. **Test coverage**: every new service method has ≥ 1 unit test.
7. **Swagger**: every new or modified public handler has Swagger
   annotations (Principle VII).
8. **API contract sync**: if the API surface changed, `swag` is
   regenerated AND the root `openapi.yaml` is updated (Phase 3).
9. **ADR**: if a material design choice was made, an ADR is added in
   `docs/adr/`.
10. **Tasks checked off**: the active `specs/NNN-*/tasks.md` items for
    this work are checked off.
11. **Decisions captured**: any cross-cutting decision is written to
    `.squad/decisions/inbox/`.
12. **Secrets scan clean**: no credentials, tokens, or API keys in the
    diff.
13. **Commit hygiene**: Conventional Commit prefix and (when
    AI-assisted) `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer present.
14. **PR self-check**: PR description cites the relevant Constitution
    Principle(s) and lists this DoD as a checklist.

## §22. Amendment Process

This section supersedes the prior brief amendment language. Constitution
changes follow a deliberate, auditable process.

1. **Propose** — Open an ADR (`docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`) with status
   `PROPOSED` describing the change and rationale.
2. **PR** — Submit the constitution change PR alongside the ADR; the PR
   description MUST link the ADR.
3. **Semver bump** — Update the version in the file header and the
   Sync Impact Report:
   - **MAJOR**: a Principle is removed or renumbered; a
     backward-incompatible governance change; restructuring of
     operational sections.
   - **MINOR**: a Principle is added; a new operational section is
     added; existing guidance is materially expanded.
   - **PATCH**: typo, clarification, or non-semantic edit.
4. **Sync Impact Report** — Update the HTML-comment header at the top
   of this file (modified principles, added/removed sections, templates
   needing follow-up, TODOs).
5. **Revision History** — Append a row to §23.
6. **Announce** — On merge, announce the change in `.squad/decisions.md`.
7. **ADR status** — Transition the ADR from `PROPOSED` to `ACCEPTED`.

Automated enforcement (`architecture_test.go`, linters, type checkers)
is always preferred over manual review. Deviations from any Principle
MUST be explicitly justified in the PR description and tracked in the
plan's Complexity Tracking table.
