## What is this?

**Ancient Coins** is a self-hosted, full-featured Progressive Web App for managing a personal ancient coin collection end-to-end. Catalog, value, analyze, organize, and share your coins with powerful AI-assisted tools, offline access, and community features — all on your own server.

**For collectors who want:**
- 🏛️ Detailed numismatic records with provenance, images, and structured references
- 🤖 AI-powered analysis of coin photos (Claude or self-hosted Ollama)
- 🔍 Smart discovery tools for finding, tracking, and monitoring coins
- 📊 Rich portfolio analytics with value trends and gap analysis
- 🤝 Social features to follow collectors and share curated collections
- 📱 Install as a PWA; offline read access on mobile and desktop
- 🔒 Complete control of data; runs entirely on your infrastructure

Built for a single collector plus invited friends. Not a marketplace, SaaS, or reference database replacement.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 🏛️ Collection Management
Organize coins with rich metadata: denomination, ruler, material, weight, inscriptions, grades, provenance, images, and free-text notes. Flexible filtering, full-text search, random shuffle with deterministic seed, and swipe/grid gallery views. **[Learn more →](docs/features/collection-management.md)**

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis
**Obverse & Reverse Analysis** — Upload coin photos for AI inspection with condition assessment, grade estimates, historical context, and market insights. Supports Anthropic Claude or self-hosted Ollama vision models.

**Multi-Team Agent System** — Specialized teams for search, shows, portfolio review, availability checks, grading, price trends, gap analysis, photography guidance, and similar-lot discovery handle different research tasks with streaming real-time status. **[Learn more →](docs/features/ai-search-agent.md)**

### 🎯 Discovery & Acquisition
**AI Coin Search** — Chat with an agent to find real dealer listings matching your description. Imports structured results with images, metadata, prices, and candidate catalog references.

**Coin Lookup** — Take or upload photos at a show to identify a coin or NGC Ancients slab. The app extracts NGC certification numbers, links to official NGC verification, enriches non-NGC lookups with Numista matches, and can save results to your wish list or collection. **[Learn more →](docs/features/coin-lookup.md)**

**Wish List** — Track coins you want with automatic availability checking, AI search, price tracking, and one-click purchase-to-collection conversion.

**Auction Tracking** — Monitor NumisBids lots through bidding lifecycle with status workflow, price alerts, bid reminders, auto-conversion to collection when won. **[Learn more →](docs/features/wish-list.md)**

### 📊 Portfolio Intelligence
**Collection Statistics** — Dashboard with portfolio value trends, category/material/grade distributions, top coins by value, era/region heat maps, ROI tracking, and health scorecards.

**Coin Sets** — Organize coins into open (flexible), defined (series with completion %), goal (milestones), or smart (rule-based automatic) sets with trend tracking, snapshots, and comparison tools. **[Learn more →](docs/features/coin-sets.md)**

### 🤝 Social & Community
**Follow Collectors** — Send follow requests, view follower galleries, leave comments, rate coins 1-5 stars.

**Profiles** — Customize avatar, bio, and privacy settings. Toggle public/private profile with follower management.

**Showcases** — Create curated public subsets with shareable URLs (e.g., `/s/favorite-denarii`). **[Learn more →](docs/features/social-features.md)**

### 📱 Mobile & Offline
**PWA Installation** — Install on iOS, Android, desktop (Chrome/Edge/Brave). Standalone app window, no browser UI.

**Offline Read Access** — Service worker caches collection data and images for offline browsing. Writes require an active network connection.

**Mobile Gestures** — Swipe gallery, pull-to-refresh, camera capture, touch-optimized controls. **[Learn more →](docs/features/pwa-features.md)**

### 🔐 Security & Control
**Multiple Auth Methods** — JWT + refresh tokens, WebAuthn passkeys (FIDO2), API keys for programmatic access.

**External Tool Server** — Expose read-only collection to external AI clients (OpenWebUI, LibreChat) via OpenAPI with scoped API keys and two-phase commit for writes.

**Fine-Grained Privacy** — Public/private profiles, per-coin privacy toggle, role-based admin access. **[Learn more →](docs/authentication.md)**

### More Features
**Structured Catalog References** — Formally link coins to RIC, RPC, SNG, Numista catalogs.
**Activity Journals** — Timestamped logs per coin (cleaned, graded, displayed).
**PDF Export** — Generate insurance catalogs with photos, provenance, valuations.
**OCR Text Extraction** — Extract text from store cards and certificates.
**Daily Featured Coins** — Automated scheduler to rediscover forgotten coins.
**Image Operations** — Background removal, circle clipping, automatic extraction.
**Bulk Operations** — Multi-select for batch tagging, status changes, exports.
**Configurable Coin Properties** — Admin-defined Era and Category option lists for tailoring collection metadata.

## Architecture

Three services, two containers in production:

```
Browser ──► Vue 3 SPA  ──► Go API (Gin, GORM, SQLite) ──► Python LangGraph Agent
            (PWA)          :8080                          :8081 (stateless, SSE)
```

| Layer    | Tech                                  | Path         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Backend  | Go 1.26 (Gin), GORM, pure-Go SQLite   | `src/api/`   |
| Frontend | Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia (PWA)  | `src/web/`   |
| Agent    | Python 3.12, FastAPI, LangGraph       | `src/agent/` |

The Go API serves both REST (`/api/*`) and the compiled Vue SPA; it proxies AI requests (including SSE streams) to the Python agent. The Python service is stateless — all configuration (provider, keys, prompts, user context) is passed per-request.

Full details in **[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**; the binding rationale is captured in **[ADR 0002 — Three-Service Architecture](docs/adr/0002-three-service-architecture.md)**.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Go 1.26+](https://go.dev/dl/), [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/), [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (optional), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional), [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (optional — for local AI).

```sh
git clone <repo-url> && cd coin-collection-app
task init        # generates .env with a random JWT secret
task up          # API (:8080) + web (:5173)
task up-all      # API + web + Python agent (:8081)
```

The first registered user becomes the admin and can configure AI providers from the Admin page. For a guided walkthrough see **[`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md)**; for production deployment see **[`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md)**.

### Running tests

```sh
task test            # Go architecture + unit tests
task test-agent      # Python agent tests
( cd src/web && npm run type-check )
```

Run `task --list` to see all targets.
