# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 1. Governance Restructure — tech-inventory alignment (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Maximus (Lead/Architect), Brian  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 1 landed  

#### What
Adopted tech-inventory governance philosophy (operational scaffolding adapted to Go/Vue/Python). Constitution v1.1.0 → v2.0.0 with eight new operational sections (§0–§23): Hierarchy of Authority, Quality Gate, AI Agent Operating Rules, Documentation Requirements, Audit Cadence, Definition of Done, Amendment Process, Revision History. All 16 original Principles preserved verbatim.

#### Key Decisions Captured
- Constitution MAJOR version bump: v1.1.0 → v2.0.0 (16 principles untouched; operational restructure warrants MAJOR)
- Seed `specs/001-foundation/` retroactively (Phase 2 work)
- `docs/prd.md` becomes product source of truth
- Split the legacy security review into `docs/security-principles.md` + `docs/threat-model.md` + `docs/incident-response.md` (Phase 3)
- Signed commits NOT required (single-developer hobby project); Conventional Commits + Co-authored-by trailer remain mandatory
- Reject signed commits per Brian's confirmation

#### Consequences
- All future features originate as `specs/_backlog/F0NN-*.md`, promote to `specs/NNN-*/spec.md`, follow SpecKit pipeline
- PRs gated on §17 Quality Gate + §21 Definition of Done (14-item checklist)
- Squad handoff via Scribe: `.squad/log/` + per-agent `history.md` + `.squad/decisions.md`
- §18 forbids `SESSION-NOTES.md` and `.copilot-state.md`

#### Impact
Establishes unambiguous document hierarchy, single Definition of Done, mechanically enforceable quality gate. Enables cross-repo governance consistency with tech-inventory while preserving Go/Vue/Python idioms.

### 2. copilot-instructions Restructure + PR Template (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Maximus (Lead/Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 1 landed  

#### What
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` restructured to cite the constitution rather than restate it. Added **Document Hierarchy** (§0), **Session Protocol** (§18 Always/Never/Handoff), **Constitution Compliance** (points to PR template §21). Architecture rules defer to Principle I + X; security cites Principles XI/XII/XIII; commit convention cites §17 + Principle VIII.

2. `.github/pull_request_template.md` created with **Summary**, **Constitution self-check** (Principle + operational section flag), **Linked work**, then the §21 Definition of Done as a 14-item executable checklist.

#### Rationale
- Constitution v2.0.0 is single source of truth; previous copilot-instructions duplicated principle text (drift risk)
- Citation style keeps docs terse; forces agents to authoritative file
- Day-to-day operational material (Build/Test/Lint, design tokens, chip/button classes, "Adding a New API Feature", endpoints) preserved — that's muscle memory
- PR template is cheapest enforcement surface for §21; GitHub UI blocks merge until each DoD item examined

#### Impact
Agents read constitution once for principles/governance; PR template gates every merge on §21 self-check. Reduces documentation drift and makes quality requirements visible on every PR.

---

### 3. Governance Scaffolding — SECURITY.md, CODEOWNERS, Templates (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Scribe, Maximus  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 1 landed  

#### What
Created governance infrastructure files:
- **SECURITY.md** — Security policy, 30-day disclosure window, responsible disclosure contact
- **.github/CODEOWNERS** — Team routing for review (TBD allocation per sprint planning)
- **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md** — Bug report template with reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, environment
- **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md** — Feature request template with use case, acceptance criteria, success metrics

#### Rationale
- Formalized security policy establishes trust and legal clarity
- CODEOWNERS automates review routing, prevents single-person merge
- Issue templates standardize problem report format (faster triage, fewer "what do you mean" back-and-forths)
- Templates are cheap organizational wins; fit "operations scaffolding" theme

#### Impact
Security reporters know where to send disclosures; maintainers can enforce review gates; users file better-structured issues. Establishes codified organizational boundaries.

### 4. Five User Decisions — tech-inventory Alignment Direction (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Brian (via Squad coordinator)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 1 planning confirmed  

#### Decision 1: Constitution Version Bump
**What:** v1.1.0 → v2.0.0 (MAJOR)  
**Why:** §17 Quality Gate, §21 DoD, §0 Hierarchy materially change agent behavior

#### Decision 2: Retroactive Spec for v1.0
**What:** Yes — seed `specs/001-foundation/` documenting existing v1.0 feature surface  
**Why:** Validates new SpecKit on-disk workflow end-to-end

#### Decision 3: PRD as Product Source of Truth
**What:** `docs/prd.md` becomes authoritative; README trimmed to setup/architecture/links  
**Why:** Cross-repo consistency, decouples product intent from build instructions

#### Decision 4: Security Analysis Split
**What:** Replace the legacy single security review with `docs/security-principles.md` (controls), `docs/threat-model.md` (findings), and `docs/incident-response.md` (operations); delete the retired file cleanly  
**Why:** Matches the tech-inventory information architecture while giving controls, live findings, and incident operations their own maintainable homes

#### Decision 5: Signed Commits on main
**What:** SKIP — single-developer hobby project  
**Why:** No team contributors; Conventional Commits + Co-authored-by trailer remain mandatory

#### Impact
Confirmed Phase 1 scope boundaries; Phase 2–4 deliverables queued. No ambiguity on version bumping, spec seeding, or security doc refactoring.

### 5. `specs/` scaffold + session-protocol prompts live (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Maximus (Lead/Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 2A landed  

#### What

1. **`specs/` workflow is live on disk** (Constitution §0 Hierarchy items 3–6):
   - `specs/NNN-feature-slug/` for active features (`spec.md` + `plan.md` + `tasks.md` required)
   - `specs/_backlog/F0NN-feature-slug.md` for queued cards
   - `specs/README.md` + `specs/_backlog/README.md` document layout, numbering (immutable), lifecycle, gates
   - `specs/_backlog/_TEMPLATE.md` is canonical 15-field card (YAML frontmatter + body sections)

2. **Promotion rule** (backlog → active): Card must be `status: triaged` with concrete acceptance criteria and named Principle + operational section. Lead assigns next free `NNN`, runs `/speckit.specify` to create `specs/NNN-slug/spec.md`, updates card to `status: promoted`, commits both in one PR.

3. **Triage cadence:** Maximus reviews all backlog cards weekly; aim to advance or drop within two cycles.

4. **4 session-protocol prompts registered** under `.github/prompts/`:
   - `load-context.prompt.md` — Cold-start; constitution + decisions + active spec + agent charter
   - `checkpoint.prompt.md` — Mid-session pause; Scribe writes to `.squad/log/{ts}-checkpoint.md`
   - `handoff.prompt.md` — End of session; Scribe reconciles `tasks.md`, merges inbox, commits
   - `audit.prompt.md` — §20 audit; findings → `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

#### Rationale
Constitution §0 needs concrete homes for Hierarchy items; 4 new prompts standardize Squad ceremonies (§18 Session Handoff). Manifest update deferred — run `specify upgrade` to register prompts in `.specify/integrations/copilot.manifest.json`.

#### Unblocks
- Retro `specs/001-foundation/` (Maximus follow-up)
- New feature requests now have documented SpecKit entry point

#### References
Constitution §0 (Hierarchy), §17 (Quality Gate), §18 (AI Agent Operating Rules), §20 (Audit), §21 (DoD), §22 (Amendment).

### 6. `specs/001-foundation/` is the v1.0 SHIPPED anchor (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Maximus (Lead/Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 2B landed  

#### What

`specs/001-foundation/` was created retroactively to document the v1.0 feature surface already shipped (Go API + Vue PWA + Python LangGraph agent, packaged as two Docker containers). It is the canonical "active feature spec" referenced by Constitution §0 Hierarchy item 3 from the moment v1.0 went live through whenever `specs/002-*/` opens.

Three files authored:
- **`spec.md` (162 lines)** — Problem, users, 6 prioritized user stories, FR-001 through FR-010, key entities, success criteria, assumptions, out-of-scope
- **`plan.md` (139 lines)** — Three-service architecture, Constitution-check table (Principles I, II, III, IV, V, VI, X, XII, XIII all PASS), 9 key decisions, tech stack rationale
- **`tasks.md` (86 lines)** — All checkboxes checked ✅ (SHIPPED), grouped by domain (Go API, Vue, Python Agent, Quality, Governance)

**Total:** 387 lines, within Brian's 400–600 line budget.

#### Rationale
1. Constitution §0 Hierarchy item 3 ("active feature spec") needs concrete content — making it fully anchored, not aspirational.
2. End-to-end SpecKit validation on known-good surface exercises the template before genuine `002-*` work.
3. Audit trail: "What was in v1.0?" now has a one-file answer.

#### Scope Boundary
- **`001-foundation/` is historical.** Not edited again except for future Constitution amendments.
- Forward-looking work opens at `specs/002-*/`, `specs/003-*/`, etc.
- Backlog cards F001–F007 are cross-linked for traceability but NOT retroactively marked `promoted` — they document v1.0 surface, not pre-shipping promotions.

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Retroactive drift:** Keep `spec.md` at capability level (FR-001–FR-010), put volatile detail in `plan.md`, tasks list by name only.
- **Retroactive precedent:** Explicitly noted in all three files — one-time anchor, not recurring practice. Future features spec-first via `/speckit.specify`.

#### References
Constitution §0 (Hierarchy of Authority, item 3), §18 (AI Agent Operating Rules), §22 (Amendment Process).

### 5. Microsoft Foundry Agent Service Migration (January 2025)

**Status:** NO-GO Recommendation (awaiting team review)  
**Proposed by:** Maximus (Lead/Architect)  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Spike Document:** `docs/spikes/foundry-agent-service.md`

#### What
Recommend NO-GO on migrating the Ancient Coins agent service from Python/LangGraph to Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (C# Agent Framework SDK).

#### Analysis
**Current:** Python/FastAPI + LangGraph; 10 multi-agent teams; stateless; SSE streaming; Anthropic + Ollama support  
**Candidate:** Azure Foundry Agent Service; C# Agent Framework SDK; managed operations; stateful sessions; Claude models via Azure

**Pros:**
- ✅ Managed scaling, deployment, monitoring
- ✅ Enterprise support (Entra ID, RBAC, VNet, Azure compliance)
- ✅ Claude models via Azure billing consolidation
- ✅ Comparable streaming and orchestration

**Cons:**
- ❌ 3–4 month migration ($115k labor)
- ❌ Complete rewrite (Python → C#, LangGraph → MAF patterns)
- ❌ High risk: web search tool availability uncertain, Claude quota issues in preview
- ❌ +20% operational overhead ($50–100/month vs. free self-hosted)
- ❌ Team skill mismatch (Python/Go/TS vs. C#/.NET learning curve)
- ❌ Stateful design mismatch with current stateless architecture
- ❌ SSE progress reporting degrades without additional engineering

**Risks:**
- **High:** Web search tool availability blocker for 40% of teams
- **High:** Claude in preview with documented quota exhaustion
- **Medium:** SearXNG integration unclear; loses Ollama option
- **Medium:** UX regression without rich progress events

#### Decision
**NO-GO at this time.** Current Python/LangGraph meets all requirements with lower operational complexity. Reconsider if: (1) strategic Azure lock-in required, (2) enterprise support becomes critical, (3) Claude exits preview with guaranteed quotas, (4) team grows 3x, (5) Foundry ships exclusive features.

**Alternative (Low-Risk):** Stay on Python/LangGraph; incrementally migrate Anthropic API calls to Azure AI Services endpoints (serverless). Benefits: billing consolidation, Entra ID, quota management. **No code rewrite** — configuration only.

#### Impact
Continue Python/LangGraph development; optimize observability and caching. Revisit annually.

### 6. Code Review & Quality Assessment (2026-04-24)

**Authors:** Maximus (Architect), Cassius (Backend), Aurelia (Frontend), Brutus (Testing)  
**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Status:** Assessed — Backlog Created  

#### What
Comprehensive review of all three services covering architecture, code quality, testing, security, and accessibility. Generated 77 backlog items across P0–P3 priorities.

#### Key Findings

**Architecture (Grade: B+)**
- Clean 3-service separation and excellent documentation (761-line ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Layered Go API enforced by architecture tests; handlers→services→repositories enforced
- DI pattern used but undermined by 3 package-level globals: `AppLogger`, `GetSetting()`, `cancelMap`
- API key middleware bypasses repository abstraction

**Backend (Grade: B-)**
- Most handlers thin; some leak business logic (analysis.go, agent.go, coins.go, admin.go)
- Sentinel errors used in 4 services; many repos silently drop errors (7+ locations in social.go)
- Non-atomic multi-step writes without transactions (auction lot, social, availability)
- Input validation sparse; page/limit defaults silently instead of validating

**Frontend (Grade: B-)**
- Good Composition API; 6 components exceed 400 lines (need splitting: AdminPage 1378, SettingsPage 1371, CoinDetailPage 1242)
- TypeScript discipline strong; very few `any` casts
- State management too lean (coins store lacks error state; auth store drifts after refresh)
- Critical gap: accessibility D+ (no ARIA, no focus traps, clickable divs not keyboard-accessible)
- PWA quality C+ (missing icons pwa-192×192 and pwa-512×512; no offline fallback, no update prompt)

**Testing (Grade: D)**
- Go: 3.5-4.6% coverage; only CoinRepository and CoinService tested; zero handler tests
- Frontend: ZERO test files, no framework
- Python: 31 tests passing; but zero tests for 11 team pipelines, supervisors, LLM provider, search tools
- No test plan, no coverage thresholds, no CI enforcement

**Security Issues (P0)**
- XSS risk in v-html AI content (Aurelia confirmed DOMPurify is used; can close)
- SQL injection in coin_repository Suggestions() method (whitelist in handler but not repo; needs defense-in-depth)
- Admin route accessible to any authenticated user (no role guard)
- Double-close panic risk in scheduler Stop() methods

#### Impact
Establishes baseline quality metrics and prioritized backlog. Guides sprint planning for next 2–3 quarters. Addresses security (P0), DI debt (P1), god-page decomposition (P2), and testing coverage expansion (ongoing).

#### Backlog Structure
- **P0 (Critical):** 8 items — security, panic bugs, auth tests
- **P1 (High):** 19 items — DI refactor, transaction safety, memory leaks, frontend testing setup
- **P2 (Medium):** 28 items — error audit, accessibility, god-page splits, test expansion
- **P3 (Low):** 22 items — performance, form validation, API polish

### 7. P0 Fixes — Admin Route Guard & v-html (2026-07-22)

**Author:** Aurelia (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-07-22  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### What
- Added `requiresAdmin: true` meta to `/admin` route; guard checks `auth.isAdmin` and redirects non-admin to `/`
- Verified v-html XSS mitigation: all 4 bindings already wrapped with `DOMPurify.sanitize()`

#### Why
Admin page was UI-hidden but route was directly accessible. v-html XSS appeared as backlog item but was already protected.

#### Impact
Admin routes now protected. Can close code review backlog items #1–2.

---

### 8. Activity Journal Scroll Limit & Auction Schedule UI (2026-05-01)

**Author:** Aurelia (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-01  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### What

Two independent UI improvements:

**Task A — Activity Journal Scroll Limit**
- Added scroll containment to CoinActivityJournal in coin detail page
- Shows max 3 entries by default; rest accessible via internal vertical scroll
- Used design tokens for scrollbar styling (--bg-card, --border-subtle, --accent-gold-dim)

**Task B — Auction-Ending Schedule in Admin UI**
- Added "Auction Ending Alerts" panel to AdminSchedulesSection mirroring wishlist pattern
- Three new settings keys: AuctionEndingCheckEnabled, AuctionEndingCheckStartTime, AuctionEndingCheckInterval
- Updated useAdminConfig composable to expose and manage auction settings state
- Integrated into AdminPage with proper prop binding

#### Why

- Task A: Prevents Activity Journal from pushing content down page as history grows; keeps layout compact
- Task B: Cassius building backend daily scheduler for auction-ending alerts; needs UI configuration in same location as wishlist/valuation schedulers

#### Impact

- Task A: Coin detail page remains compact with unbounded journal history
- Task B: Users can enable and configure auction-ending scheduler alongside existing background schedulers

#### Testing

- vue-tsc passes clean (no TypeScript errors)
- Nullish coalescing and optional chaining used correctly for Docker strictness
- All design tokens applied (no hardcoded values)

### 4. Auction Ending Manual Trigger & Run Log — Backend Implementation (2026-06-10)

**Author:** Cassius (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-06-10  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### What

Added manual run trigger and per-run logging to Auction Ending scheduler for parity with Valuation and Wishlist schedulers:

1. **Model:** `models/auction_ending_run.go` — 10 fields (ID, TriggerType, TriggerUserID, Status, LotsChecked, AlertsSent, DurationMs, StartedAt, CompletedAt, ErrorMessage)
2. **Repository:** `repository/auction_ending_repository.go` — CreateRun, CompleteRun, ListRuns (paginated), GetRunByID, PruneOldRuns
3. **Service:** Refactored `services/auction_ending_scheduler.go` — Added RunNow(triggerUserID) method, extracted runCycleWithTrigger() to log every run
4. **Handler:** `handlers/auction_ending_admin.go` — Two endpoints: POST /api/admin/auction-ending/run (manual trigger), GET /api/admin/auction-ending-runs (run history)
5. **Wiring:** Updated main.go to instantiate scheduler early and pass to admin handler
6. **Database:** Added AuctionEndingRun to AutoMigrate in database/database.go
7. **Documentation:** Updated README.md Background Schedulers section

#### Why

Auction Ending scheduler needed manual-run capability and run logging to achieve feature parity with Valuation and Wishlist schedulers. Enables administrators to manually trigger checks and inspect historical run performance.

#### API Contract

**POST /api/admin/auction-ending/run** (admin only, returns 200 with run details on success)
- Response: {runId, lotsChecked, alertsSent, status, durationMs}

**GET /api/admin/auction-ending-runs?page=1&limit=20** (admin only, paginated)
- Response: {runs: [...], total, page, limit}
- Each run: {id, triggerType, triggerUserId, status, lotsChecked, alertsSent, durationMs, startedAt, completedAt, errorMessage, createdAt}

#### Architecture Compliance

- Model/Repository/Handler follow exact pattern of valuation_run (100% consistency)
- Pagination enforces defaults (page≥1, limit 1-100, default 20)
- Auto-pruning keeps 100 most recent runs
- Transaction safety via Updates() with map in CompleteRun
- Swagger annotations on both handler methods
- Auth/admin guards on both endpoints

#### Testing

✅ All tests pass:
- go vet clean
- go test -v ./... passed
- Architecture tests passed

---

### 5. Auction Ending Manual Trigger & Run Log — Frontend UI (2026-05-21)

**Author:** Aurelia (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-21  
**Status:** Implemented (minor follow-up fixup pending)

#### What

Implemented admin UI for manual trigger and run history display in AdminSchedulesSection:

1. **API Client:** Added triggerAuctionEndingCheck(), getAuctionEndingRuns(), getAuctionEndingRunDetail() in client.ts
2. **Types:** Added AuctionEndingRun and AuctionEndingResult interfaces in types/index.ts
3. **Composable:** Extended useAdminConfig with auctionSettingsMsg, auctionSettingsError state; added defaults handling
4. **Component:** 
   - "Run Now" button in Auction Ending section
   - Recent runs table with columns: Date, Trigger, Lots, Alerts, Status, Duration
   - Expandable detail rows for error messages
   - Pagination controls with loading state
   - Responsive mobile layout

#### Why

Cassius implemented backend manual trigger and run log; frontend needed corresponding UI in AdminSchedulesSection to match Valuation/Wishlist patterns.

#### Testing

- npm run type-check passed
- npm run build succeeded (production build)
- All global design tokens used (no hardcodes)
- Followed Composition API patterns from existing admin components

#### Known Issue

Aurelia guessed endpoint URL `/admin/auction-ending/runs` but Cassius's actual endpoint is `/admin/auction-ending-runs` (hyphenated). Follow-up fixup spawn (aurelia-auction-fixup) in flight to align client.ts URL.

---

### 6. Auction Ending Manual Trigger & Run Log — Test Coverage (2026-05-22)

**Author:** Brutus (Tester/QA)  
**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Status:** **APPROVED**  

#### What

Comprehensive test suite for Cassius's auction-ending manual-run and run-log implementation:

**Repository Tests (10 tests in auction_ending_repository_test.go):**
- CreateRun (ID assignment, timestamp population)
- CompleteRun success and error paths (status, timestamps, error message persistence)
- ListRuns (newest-first ordering, pagination, empty results)
- ListRuns pagination edge cases (limit defaults, negative limits, zero limits)
- GetRunByID (found and not-found paths)

**Handler Tests (6 tests in auction_ending_admin_test.go):**
- TriggerRun endpoint (admin authorization, user rejection, no-auth rejection)
- ListRuns endpoint (admin authorization, pagination param handling, no-auth rejection)

#### Why

Cassius completed manual-run and run-log feature; comprehensive test coverage validates architecture compliance, error handling, authorization guards, and pagination safety.

#### Quality Assessment

✅ **Strengths:**
- 100% pattern consistency with valuation/wishlist schedulers
- Transaction safety via Updates() with map
- Pagination defaults enforced (page≥1, limit 1-100, default 20)
- Error handling and pruning strategy robust
- Complete Swagger annotations
- Auth/admin guards on both endpoints

⚠️ **Minor Observations (not blocking):**
- PruneOldRuns silently fails on error (suggest adding log line, low priority)
- No cancel endpoint (acceptable for fast runs, flag for future if runs become long-running)

#### Verdict

**APPROVED** — All 16 tests pass. Architecture compliance excellent. No blocking issues. Production-ready.

#### Recommendation

Merge to main. Optional improvements (logging, E2E tests) can be backlog items for future sprint.

### 7. Auction Ending Scheduler Implementation

**Author:** Cassius (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-21  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### What

Built a new background scheduler that notifies users via Pushover when auction lots they are bidding on have a sale date of today.

#### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
1. `src/api/services/auction_ending_scheduler.go` — Scheduler service following the exact pattern of `availability_scheduler.go`:
   - `Start()` / `Stop()` lifecycle with `sync.Once` for safe shutdown
   - `timeUntilNextRun()` calculates next run based on start time + interval
   - `runCycle()` fetches ending auctions, groups by user, sends consolidated notifications
   - In-memory idempotency tracking via `lastNotified map[uint]string` (userID → date string YYYY-MM-DD)

2. `src/api/repository/auction_lot_repository_test.go` — Unit tests for the new repository method:
   - `TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday` — Verifies only BIDDING lots with today's sale date are returned
   - `TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday_MultipleUsers` — Verifies multi-user grouping and ordering

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/api/services/settings_service.go` — Added constants for scheduler settings:
   - `SettingAuctionEndingCheckEnabled` (default: `"false"`)
   - `SettingAuctionEndingCheckInterval` (default: `"1440"` — 24 hours in minutes)
   - `SettingAuctionEndingCheckStartTime` (default: `"08:00"`)

2. `src/api/repository/auction_lot_repository.go` — Added `GetEndingToday()` method:
   - Returns all auction lots where `status = "bidding"` AND `sale_date >= startOfDay` AND `sale_date < endOfDay`
   - Uses server's local timezone for "today" calculation
   - Orders by `user_id ASC, sale_date ASC` for efficient grouping

3. `src/api/main.go` — Wired scheduler startup alongside existing schedulers

4. `src/api/README.md` — Added "Background Schedulers" section

#### Idempotency Approach

**Decision:** In-memory tracking via `lastNotified map[uint]string` on the scheduler struct.

**Rationale:**
- Simplest implementation — no schema changes, no DB writes on every check
- Sufficient for daily cadence — map is cleared on server restart, acceptable for once-daily scheduler
- Memory footprint negligible (one string per user)
- Prevents duplicate notifications if scheduler runs multiple times in a day

#### Notification Format

**Title:** "Auctions Ending Today"

**Message:** 
```
3 auction(s) you are bidding on end today:

• Heritage Auctions - Long Beach Sale (Lot 42)
• Stack's Bowers - ANA Auction (Lot 1205)
• Roma Numismatics - E-Sale 99 (Lot 348)
```

#### Testing

✅ All tests pass:
- `TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday` — Filters by status and date correctly
- `TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday_MultipleUsers` — Groups and orders correctly
- All existing architecture tests pass

---

### 8. Auction Ending Scheduler — NULL Date Handling Fix

**Author:** Cassius (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### Problem

Brian ran the auction ending scheduler manually on May 22, 2026. The scheduler reported 0 lots checked and 0 alerts sent, even though Brian has a Heritage Auctions Europe lot (Lot #8325, sale date May 22, 2026, status BIDDING) that should have been flagged.

#### Root Cause

The `AuctionLotRepository.GetEndingToday()` query only checked the `sale_date` field:

```sql
WHERE status = 'bidding' 
  AND sale_date >= startOfDay 
  AND sale_date < endOfDay
```

The `AuctionLot` model has TWO nullable date fields:
- `SaleDate *time.Time` — the sale/auction day (populated by NumisBids scraper)
- `AuctionEndTime *time.Time` — precise ending time (not used by NumisBids scraper)

When `sale_date` is NULL, the SQL comparison evaluates to NULL (not TRUE), and the row is excluded from results — even if `auction_end_time` is set to today.

**Why Brian's Heritage lot had `sale_date = NULL`:**
1. Heritage Auctions URLs are not supported by the NumisBids scraper
2. `ParseSaleDate()` only handles NumisBids date formats
3. Lot may have been created manually via the UI or API
4. Heritage auctions may populate `auction_end_time` but leave `sale_date` empty

#### Solution

Updated `AuctionLotRepository.GetEndingToday()` to check BOTH date fields with explicit NULL guards:

```sql
WHERE status = 'bidding' AND (
  (sale_date IS NOT NULL AND sale_date >= startOfDay AND sale_date < endOfDay) OR
  (auction_end_time IS NOT NULL AND auction_end_time >= startOfDay AND auction_end_time < endOfDay)
)
```

**Logic:**
- If `sale_date` is set and is today → include the lot
- If `auction_end_time` is set and is today → include the lot
- If both are set, include if either matches today (union, not intersection)
- If both are NULL, exclude the lot

#### Changes

**Modified:**
- `src/api/repository/auction_lot_repository.go` — Updated `GetEndingToday()` query with OR logic

**Added:**
- `src/api/repository/auction_lot_repository_test.go` — New test case: "bidding lot with auction_end_time today (no sale_date)"

#### Testing

✅ All tests pass (`go test -v ./...`):
- Lot with `sale_date = today, auction_end_time = NULL` → included ✅
- Lot with `sale_date = NULL, auction_end_time = today` → included ✅ (new test)
- Lot with `sale_date = NULL, auction_end_time = NULL` → excluded ✅

#### Impact

**Positive:**
- Fixes Heritage Auctions bug: lots with `auction_end_time` set but no `sale_date` are now detected
- Future-proof: supports any auction source that uses `auction_end_time` instead of `sale_date`
- No breaking changes: existing NumisBids lots continue to work exactly as before

**Risks:** None identified. The OR logic is additive and doesn't change behavior for existing data.

### 9. PWA Service Worker Lifecycle Fix

**Author:** Aurelia (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-23  
**Status:** Implemented  

#### What

Fixed critical PWA service worker update failure that left users stuck with stale service workers trying to import non-existent workbox files.

**Changes:**
1. Added `import { registerSW } from 'virtual:pwa-register'` to `src/web/src/main.ts` with `immediate: true` to wire up vite-plugin-pwa's auto-update lifecycle
2. Added hourly service worker update check (`setInterval` calling `registration.update()` every 60 minutes)
3. Added `/// <reference types="vite-plugin-pwa/client" />` to `env.d.ts` for TypeScript support of virtual module
4. Typed `onRegisteredSW` callback parameters to satisfy strict TypeScript checking

**Icons verification:**
- `pwa-192x192.png` and `pwa-512x512.png` already existed in `public/` (547 bytes and 1.9 KB respectively)
- Manifest correctly references both icons plus maskable variant
- No action needed on icon side — the browser error was a symptom of the stale SW issue

#### Why

**Root Cause:** The service worker registration was never initialized. `vite.config.ts` had all the correct configuration (`registerType: 'autoUpdate'`, `skipWaiting: true`, `clientsClaim: true`, `cleanupOutdatedCaches: true`), but `main.ts` didn't import the virtual module that triggers registration.

**Impact on Users:** After a deploy, the build emitted a new `sw.js` and `workbox-{NEW_HASH}.js`, but users with the old `sw.js` in their cache kept trying to `importScripts('workbox-{OLD_HASH}.js')` — which no longer existed on the server. This violates the service worker spec (no new script imports post-install) and threw `NetworkError: Failed to import`.

#### How It Works Now

1. **On page load:** `registerSW({ immediate: true })` registers the service worker
2. **On new deploy:** Browser detects `sw.js` has changed, downloads new SW, which `skipWaiting()` immediately activates and `clientsClaim()` takes control without waiting for tab close
3. **Hourly update check:** `registration.update()` proactively checks for new SW versions even if user doesn't reload
4. **Cleanup:** `cleanupOutdatedCaches: true` prunes old workbox-{hash}.js files from cache storage

#### User-Facing Impact

**Existing users on stale SW:** On their **next page load** after this deploy, the broken old SW will serve them one last time, fetch the new SW (which auto-activates), and then the new lifecycle takes over. They may see the error once more in the console but won't after the refresh.

**Recommended:** Users can force-clear the issue immediately by opening DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister, then hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R). For most users, a single refresh after deploy will resolve it.

#### Testing

✅ `npm run type-check` passes  
✅ `npm run build` succeeds — generates fresh `sw.js` and `workbox-{HASH}.js`  
✅ Icons present in `dist/` (192x192 and 512x512)  
✅ Manifest correctly references both icon sizes and maskable variant

### 10. Auction Ending Scheduler — Debug Endpoint for Ground-Truth Investigation

**Author:** Cassius (Backend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Status:** Implemented — Awaiting Production Data  

#### Problem

Brian's Heritage Auctions lot (Lot #8325, displayed sale date May 22, 2026, status BIDDING) was not flagged by the auction ending scheduler. After the first bugfix (NULL-date handling for `sale_date` and `auction_end_time`), Brian redeployed and re-ran the manual trigger — **still 0 lots found**. Same 10ms execution time (suspiciously identical to the first failed run).

#### Root Cause Analysis

##### First-Pass Diagnosis (INCOMPLETE)

The initial fix assumed the lot had either `sale_date` or `auction_end_time` populated. The query was updated to check both fields with NULL guards. This was a **guess based on schema**, not real data inspection.

##### Second-Pass Audit (CRITICAL FINDINGS)

**Exhaustive Date Field Inventory:**

The `AuctionLot` model has **THREE** ways to represent an end date:

1. **`SaleDate *time.Time`** — populated by NumisBids scraper
2. **`AuctionEndTime *time.Time`** — precise ending timestamp (rarely used)
3. **`EventID *uint`** — foreign key to `AuctionEvent` which has `StartDate` and `EndDate` fields

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Heritage lots likely have `EventID` set (linking to a calendar event) but both `SaleDate` and `AuctionEndTime` are NULL. **The displayed sale date in the UI comes from `AuctionEvent.EndDate`, NOT the lot's own date fields.**

This means the current scheduler query (`WHERE (sale_date today OR auction_end_time today)`) **completely misses lots whose date is inherited from a parent event**.

**Other Hypotheses Ruled Out:**

- **Status mismatch:** `models.AuctionStatusBidding` constant is lowercase `"bidding"` — matches DB enum values
- **User scope filter:** No user_id WHERE clause in scheduler query — iterates all users
- **Case sensitivity:** SQLite is case-insensitive for string comparisons by default
- **Time zone issues:** All date comparisons use `now.Location()` consistently

#### Solution

##### Debug Endpoint (Implemented)

Added `GET /api/admin/auction-ending/debug` that returns:

```json
{
  "now": "2026-05-22T19:09:00Z",
  "today_start": "2026-05-22T00:00:00Z",
  "today_end": "2026-05-23T00:00:00Z",
  "query_summary": "WHERE status = 'bidding' AND ((sale_date >= X AND sale_date < Y) OR (auction_end_time >= X AND auction_end_time < Y))",
  "total_lots_in_db": 42,
  "lots_by_status": { "bidding": 3, "watching": 12, "won": 5, ... },
  "lots_matching_query": [
    { "id": 10, "lot_number": 1234, "status": "bidding", "sale_date": "2026-05-22T10:00:00Z", ... }
  ],
  "all_bidding_lots": [
    { "id": 42, "lot_number": 8325, "status": "bidding", "sale_date": null, "auction_end_time": null, "event_id": 7, "event_end_date": "2026-05-22" }
  ]
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Read-only:** No side effects, no notifications sent
2. **Admin-only:** Requires admin role + JWT auth
3. **Comprehensive data:** Includes ALL BIDDING lots with ALL date fields (including event dates via LEFT JOIN)
4. **Architecture compliance:** All SQL queries delegated to repository layer (`AuctionLotRepository.GetAllBiddingLotsWithEventDates()`)
5. **Swagger annotations:** Fully documented API contract

##### SQL Query for Immediate Inspection

Brian can run this query directly against the SQLite DB **right now** to confirm the hypothesis:

```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  user_id, 
  status, 
  lot_number, 
  sale_date, 
  auction_end_time, 
  event_id, 
  created_at, 
  updated_at 
FROM auction_lots 
WHERE lot_number = 8325 
   OR status = 'bidding' 
ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected result:** Lot 8325 has `sale_date = NULL`, `auction_end_time = NULL`, `event_id = <some_id>`. The end date is stored on the linked `AuctionEvent` row.

#### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**

1. `src/api/handlers/auction_ending_debug.go` — Debug handler with `DebugGetAuctionEndingInfo()` method

**Files Modified:**

1. `src/api/repository/auction_lot_repository.go` — Added `GetAllBiddingLotsWithEventDates()` method (raw SQL with LEFT JOIN to auction_events)
2. `src/api/main.go` — Wired debug handler into `/admin/auction-ending/debug` route

**Architecture Compliance:**

- ✅ All SQL queries in repository layer (no raw SQL in handlers)
- ✅ Handler is thin (delegates to repo, returns JSON)
- ✅ Admin route group enforces authorization
- ✅ Swagger annotations present
- ✅ All tests pass (`go vet` clean, `go test -v ./...` clean)

#### Next Steps (DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT DATA)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT modify `GetEndingToday()` again until Brian provides either:

1. The output of the SQL query above, OR
2. The response from `GET /api/admin/auction-ending/debug` from his deployed instance

**Once we have ground truth, the fix will likely be:**

```go
// Option A: Check event end date in addition to lot dates
func (r *AuctionLotRepository) GetEndingToday() ([]models.AuctionLot, error) {
    var lots []models.AuctionLot
    now := time.Now()
    startOfDay := time.Date(now.Year(), now.Month(), now.Day(), 0, 0, 0, 0, now.Location())
    endOfDay := startOfDay.Add(24 * time.Hour)

    query := `
        SELECT al.* 
        FROM auction_lots al
        LEFT JOIN auction_events ae ON al.event_id = ae.id
        WHERE al.status = ? AND (
            (al.sale_date IS NOT NULL AND al.sale_date >= ? AND al.sale_date < ?) OR
            (al.auction_end_time IS NOT NULL AND al.auction_end_time >= ? AND al.auction_end_time < ?) OR
            (ae.end_date IS NOT NULL AND ae.end_date >= ? AND ae.end_date < ?)
        )
        ORDER BY al.user_id ASC
    `
    err := r.db.Raw(query, models.AuctionStatusBidding,
        startOfDay, endOfDay,  // sale_date range
        startOfDay, endOfDay,  // auction_end_time range
        startOfDay, endOfDay). // event end_date range
        Scan(&lots).Error
    return lots, err
}
```

**Test case to add:**

```go
// TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday_EventDate verifies lots linked to events
// with end_date = today are included even if sale_date and auction_end_time are NULL
func TestAuctionLotRepository_GetEndingToday_EventDate(t *testing.T) {
    db := setupTestDB(t)
    repo := repository.NewAuctionLotRepository(db)
    
    now := time.Now()
    today := time.Date(now.Year(), now.Month(), now.Day(), 15, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
    
    // Create an auction event ending today
    event := models.AuctionEvent{
        UserID:       1,
        Title:        "Heritage Auction 90",
        AuctionHouse: "Heritage Auctions Europe",
        EndDate:      &today,
    }
    db.Create(&event)
    
    // Create a bidding lot linked to the event, with NO sale_date or auction_end_time
    lot := models.AuctionLot{
        UserID:       1,
        Status:       models.AuctionStatusBidding,
        LotNumber:    8325,
        EventID:      &event.ID,
        SaleDate:     nil,
        AuctionEndTime: nil,
    }
    db.Create(&lot)
    
    // GetEndingToday should find this lot via event join
    lots, err := repo.GetEndingToday()
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Len(t, lots, 1)
    assert.Equal(t, lot.ID, lots[0].ID)
}
```

#### Lessons Learned

**NEVER ship a query fix without inspecting real production data.**

The first fix was based on schema assumptions, not reality. This second-pass added:

1. A debug endpoint to expose ground truth
2. A SQL query Brian can run immediately
3. A commitment to NOT change the query again until we have confirmation

This is the correct workflow for data-dependent bugfixes.

#### API Contract

##### GET /api/admin/auction-ending/debug

**Auth:** Admin only (JWT or API key)  
**Response:** 200 OK

```json
{
  "now": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "today_start": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "today_end": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "query_summary": "Human-readable WHERE clause",
  "total_lots_in_db": 42,
  "lots_by_status": { "bidding": 3, "watching": 12, ... },
  "lots_matching_query": [ /* array of AuctionLot */ ],
  "all_bidding_lots": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "lotNumber": 8325,
      "status": "bidding",
      "saleDate": null,
      "auctionEndTime": null,
      "eventId": 7,
      "eventEndDate": "2026-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "auctionHouse": "Heritage Auctions Europe",
      "saleName": "Auction 90",
      "userId": 1
    }
  ],
  "explanation": {
    "lots_matching_query": "...",
    "all_bidding_lots": "..."
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 401 Unauthorized — No auth token or API key
- 403 Forbidden — User is not admin
- 500 Internal Server Error — DB query failed

#### Impact

**Positive:**
- Brian can immediately inspect his production data without waiting for another deploy
- Debug endpoint is reusable for future scheduler issues
- Prevents third failed fix by waiting for ground truth first

**Risks:** None — endpoint is read-only and admin-only

#### Testing

✅ All tests pass:
- `go vet` clean
- `go test -v ./...` passed
- Architecture tests passed (no raw SQL in handlers)

### 11. ADR Practice Established (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Maximus (Lead / Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 3a landed  

#### What

The project now has a formal Architecture Decision Record practice under `docs/adr/`, using the Michael Nygard format. Four ADRs landed in this batch:

- **ADR 0001** — Record Architecture Decisions (the practice itself)
- **ADR 0002** — Three-Service Architecture (Vue PWA / Go API / Python agent)
- **ADR 0003** — JWT Auth with Refresh Tokens and WebAuthn Passkeys
- **ADR 0004** — Design Token System (CSS custom properties, Tailwind rejected)

ADRs 0002–0004 are retroactive — they document v1.0-era decisions that previously lived only in code, commit history, and oral tradition.

#### Why This Matters

Constitution v2.0.0 §22 (Amendment Process) mandates ADR-first for material design choices. Before today that requirement pointed at an empty directory. **§22 is now operational** — there is a real practice, a real template, a real index, and a real precedent.

#### Rationale

- §22 now has concrete operational precedent — any future material decision must open with an ADR PR
- Retroactive ADRs 0002–0004 document v1.0-era decisions previously in code/commits only
- Index location: `docs/adr/README.md` (process notes + numbered table)
- ADR is cited from spec/plan/tasks and PR description per §17 Quality Gate

#### References

- Constitution §22 (Amendment Process)
- Constitution §19 (Documentation Requirements)
- Constitution Principles I, II, V, XII, XIII (referenced by the four ADRs)

### 12. README Trimmed; `docs/prd.md` is Product Source of Truth (2026-05-28)

**Author:** Maximus (Lead / Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 3a landed  

#### What

1. **`docs/prd.md` is the product source of truth** per Constitution §0 item #2. All product narrative, personas, goals, non-goals, and functional-area descriptions live there. PRD is reviewed as **APPROVED** for this role as of v1 (2026-05-28).

2. **`README.md` is a thin navigation surface only** — now contains: tagline, one-paragraph "what is this" → PRD link, compact three-service architecture diagram, Quick Start, Documentation index, Governance section, license. Size: **90 lines / ~5.8 KB** (down from 368 / 25.4 KB).

3. **Product detail in README is now a §0 violation.** Any future product-level claims (feature lists, personas, scope) must land in `docs/prd.md`; README links to it.

4. **No content orphaned.** Every removed detail was already in `docs/prd.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features.md`, `docs/authentication.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, ADRs, or `specs/_backlog/F00N-*.md` cards.

5. **PRD verdict: APPROVED.** Vision is substantive; three personas defined with goals/frustrations/success measures; eleven functional areas cross-link to F00N cards and `specs/001-foundation/spec.md`; constitution citations correct; no blocking gaps.

#### Rationale

- Constitution §0 Hierarchy ranks PRD as item #2 (second only to constitution); README is now observably subordinate
- Reduces documentation drift — one place to update (PRD) and one place to cite (§17 Quality Gate)
- New contributors follow single funnel: README → PRD / ARCHITECTURE / Constitution / Specs

#### Consequences

- **+** README is finally an entry point, not a competing source of truth
- **+** Future PRs drifting product scope have one place to update
- **+** §0 Hierarchy now observably enforced in top-level docs
- **−** PRD is one click away (acceptable; audience is contributors)
- **−** Documentation drift risk shifts to "PRD vs reality"; mitigation: PRD updates part of spec workflow (§19)

#### References

- Constitution §0 (Hierarchy of Authority), §17 (Quality Gate), §19 (Documentation Requirements), §22 (Amendment Process)
- `docs/prd.md` v1 (2026-05-28)
- ADR 0001 (record architecture decisions), ADR 0002 (three-service architecture), ADR 0004 (design token system)

### 13. PRD §8 Open-Question Triage + Manifest Correction (2026-05-28)

**Status:** Decided
**Owner:** Maximus (triage facilitation), Brian (decisions)

#### What

Two related housekeeping outcomes captured in one entry:

**A. PRD §8 — six open product questions triaged with Brian:**

| # | Question | Decision | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Public ad-hoc per-coin share links | **Yes** | Promoted → `specs/_backlog/F008-public-coin-share-links.md` |
| 2 | Monthly portfolio valuation snapshots | **Yes** | Promoted → `specs/_backlog/F009-portfolio-monthly-snapshots.md` |
| 3 | Multi-user shared collections | **No** | Closed; single-user accounts only |
| 4 | Export formats beyond JSON/PDF (CSV, BIBTEX) | **No** | Closed; JSON + PDF are sufficient |
| 5 | Sold coins re-acquirable | **No** | Closed; sold = immutable history (re-buys are new entries) |
| 6 | Structured dealer/source database | **Yes** | Promoted → `specs/_backlog/F010-dealer-source-database.md` |

`docs/prd.md` §8 rewritten as a "Resolved Product Questions" table; closed items reference this decision for re-open requirements.

**B. `.specify/integrations/copilot.manifest.json` is NOT a prompt discovery file.**

Prior session note suggested running `specify upgrade` to "register" the four new session-protocol prompts (`load-context`, `checkpoint`, `handoff`, `audit`). On inspection: the manifest is an inventory of SpecKit-installed files with SHA-256 hashes used by `specify check` for drift detection of SpecKit's own artifacts. Copilot CLI discovers prompts in `.github/prompts/` directly — manifest registration is neither required nor appropriate. Adding non-SpecKit files to the manifest would falsely claim SpecKit owns them and cause future `specify check` runs to flag drift incorrectly.

**Verification:** `specify check` reports *"Specify CLI is ready to use!"* — no action needed. Our four custom prompts remain in `.github/prompts/` and are discoverable as-is.

#### Rationale

- Single-user product scope is preserved (Q3, Q5) — protects schema simplicity and Principle VI (Data Integrity & Immutability)
- Export surface stays minimal (Q4) — avoids feature-creep that the existing PDF export already covers for offline use
- Three Yes answers (Q1/Q2/Q6) each map to a single, scoped backlog card with constitution alignment notes — they enter the spec-driven workflow at the F-card stage, not as ad-hoc work
- Manifest correction prevents a follow-on session from making an actively harmful "fix"

#### Consequences

- **+** PRD §8 is now a decision log, not a question list — future contributors see the answers
- **+** F008/F009/F010 carry full constitution citations and open questions for the spec author to resolve at promotion time
- **+** Decision record corrects the manifest misread before any commit acted on it
- **−** Three new backlog items now compete for prioritization; addressed by P2/P2/P3 split (Q3 dealer DB is lowest)
- **−** Re-opening Q3, Q4, or Q5 in the future requires either a constitution amendment (Q3 — schema implication) or a new PRD entry citing this decision

#### References

- `docs/prd.md` §8 (Resolved Product Questions)
- `specs/_backlog/F008-public-coin-share-links.md`
- `specs/_backlog/F009-portfolio-monthly-snapshots.md`
- `specs/_backlog/F010-dealer-source-database.md`
- `.specify/integrations/copilot.manifest.json` (left unchanged; verified via `specify check`)
- Constitution §0 (Hierarchy), §19 (Documentation Requirements), §22 (Amendment Process)

---

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction

### 14. Keep `ci.yml` filename for Quality Gate (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Cassius, Coordinator  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 3b landed

#### What

Constitution §17 requires a named `Quality Gate`, but the repository already documents `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in multiple places and Phase 3b has security-doc and specification work running in locked or parallel workstreams. Renaming the file now would create cross-workstream churn and force follow-up cleanup in locked documents.

#### Decision

Keep the file path as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, but change the workflow `name:` to `"Quality Gate"` in the UI. Expand the workflow to enforce the full Go, Vue, Python, and OpenAPI drift checks mandated by §17.

#### Consequences

- File-path references in existing docs, handoff logs, and branch protection rules remain stable
- Workflow name is "Quality Gate" in GitHub Actions UI, fulfilling §17 textual requirement
- Avoids unnecessary documentation churn during Phase 3b while still exposing the constitutionally required identity
- Leaves room for a future rename once Maximus's security-doc updates and branch-protection expectations are aligned

#### Impact

CI Quality Gate fully operational with zero cross-team disruption. Satisfies §17 substance without process overhead.

---

### 15. Clean Security Doc Split — No Deprecated Stubs (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Maximus, Coordinator  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** ACCEPTED — Phase 3b landed

#### What

The monolithic `docs/security-analysis.md` has been retired entirely (no redirect stub). Its content is replaced with three purpose-built documents:

- `docs/security-principles.md` — stable controls and governance posture
- `docs/threat-model.md` — live finding inventory (24 findings catalogued)
- `docs/incident-response.md` — operational response playbook

#### Decision

Delete the retired file cleanly. Update all live references (Constitution, README, docs/) to point to the three new documents. No 301-style redirect or stub left in the codebase.

#### Consequences

- **+** Each of the three concerns (principles, findings, response) has a dedicated, maintainable home
- **+** Future ADRs, security audits, and incident runbooks have unambiguous anchors
- **+** No ambiguity about "which doc should this update go into?" — the three purposes are distinct
- **−** Readers of old git history who click a `docs/security-analysis.md` link see a 404; they must infer the new location from the commit history
- **+** Historical context is available in git; only the current docs set is curated

#### Rationale

A deprecated stub would preserve the old name but keep the repo anchored to the wrong information architecture. The cleaner cut is to update live references now and let the three replacements become the only maintained security surface.

#### References

- `docs/security-principles.md` (new)
- `docs/threat-model.md` (new)
- `docs/incident-response.md` (new)
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (updated 4 stale refs)

---

### 16. Propose F011 — Browser E2E Smoke Tests (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Brutus  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** PROPOSAL — captured for Phase 4+ backlog

#### What

Phase 3b testing audit revealed no browser end-to-end test harness in `src/web/`. The project has strong unit/contract coverage (Go 118 tests, Vue 61 tests, Python 35 tests), but the highest-value user journeys lack automated full-stack smoke coverage.

#### Proposal

Create a new backlog card at `specs/_backlog/F011-browser-e2e-smoke-tests.md` with scope:

- Add a minimal browser E2E framework (Playwright preferred for VS Code integrations and cross-platform reliability)
- Cover only critical deterministic journeys: login/refresh, create/edit coin, collection pagination/filtering, one admin-only protected route
- Run against local dev stack or CI service containers without calling real third-party AI providers
- Keep fixtures seeded and deterministic; avoid snapshot-heavy or CSS-fragile assertions
- Integrate into Quality Gate workflow: run after unit/lint gates are green, before merge

#### Rationale

Full-stack coverage closes the test pyramid — currently we have strong unit tests but no confirmation that the three services interact correctly end-to-end in a browser context. Browser E2E also catches CSS/routing/state-management issues that unit tests miss.

#### Consequences

- **+** Closes highest-impact testing gap (user journey coverage)
- **+** Catches integration bugs across frontend/backend/agent at merge time
- **+** Provides regression-prevention for refactors (e.g., DRY scheduler extraction in #163)
- **−** Adds CI time (~90s–120s for 5–8 smoke tests)
- **−** Requires Playwright SDK + test fixtures (minimal; ~20–30 lines of setup)

#### Linked Issues / Backlog

- Issue #163 (Code & Security Audit) — DRY scheduler refactor will benefit from E2E regression suite
- Will be filed as `F011` backlog card once Phase 4 planning begins

---

### 17. Next Coding Queue — Issue #163 (Security Audit / SWE Best Practices / DRY) + 8 Dependabot PRs (2026-05-28)

**Authors:** Brian (via Copilot CLI), Coordinator  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** CAPTURED — post-Phase-3b queue

#### What

After Phase 3b governance scaffolding lands, the next coding update is:

1. **Issue #163** — Code & security audit (squad lead: Cassius)
2. **Eight Dependabot PRs** — dependency updates across Go, npm, and Python

#### Issue #163 Scope (Refined 2026-05-28T18:36Z)

The original "agentic coding framework" goal is **complete** (Phases 1–3a: Constitution v2.0.0, copilot-instructions, PRD, ADRs, backlog F001–F007, commits 0dbd180 / 2965c31 / 01f5f1a / 5a3fd54). The remaining audit work has **three explicit pillars**:

**Pillar 1: Security Audit**
- Full codebase review; correlate findings with `security-scan.yml` output (gitleaks + govulncheck + npm audit + pip-audit, landing in Phase 3b)
- Cross-reference with `docs/threat-model.md`
- Categorize Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Open follow-up issues for Critical/High items; apply inline fixes for Low
- Merge all 8 Dependabot PRs (the visible surface; also check Dependabot alerts tab for any without a PR)

**Pillar 2: Software Engineering Best Practices**
- Vue: identify "God components" (>300 lines, mixed concerns), verify Composition API + TypeScript, check design tokens (no hardcodes), verify API calls through `client.ts`, check prop-drilling vs. Pinia
- Go: verify four-layer rule (handler → service → repository → database) across all packages, error handling consistency (sentinel vs. wrapped), context propagation, GORM scope reuse, no raw SQL in handlers, Swagger annotations on all public methods
- Python (agent): check Pydantic schemas at all boundaries, `app/llm/provider.py` single point of model resolution, structured logging via `app/logging_config.py`

**Pillar 3: DRY Across Subsystems**
- **Schedulers:** Extract shared base scheduler pattern from `coin_of_day_scheduler.go`, `auction_ending_scheduler.go`, and upcoming `valuation_snapshot_scheduler.go` (F009). Consolidate: daily-trigger loop, per-user opt-in check, admin-settings reader, in-memory + DB idempotency, manual-trigger endpoint pattern.
- **AI Agents:** Hunt duplicated pipeline scaffolding in `app/teams/` — Search→Format, Search→Verify→Format, Vision→Format. Check for shared StateGraph builder or repeated `create_react_agent` wiring.
- **Frontend:** Modal wrappers, list-with-pagination components, form-validation helpers — flag any copy-pasted patterns that should be composables.
- **API handlers:** Repeated boilerplate (parse → call service → translate error → return). Flag top 3–5 highest-value abstractions; let Brian prioritize.

**Deliverable Shape:**
- Single comment on #163 with Critical/High/Medium/Low findings
- Follow-up issues opened for Critical/High items
- All 8 Dependabot PRs merged (or rejected with documented reason)
- DRY proposal section highlighting top 3–5 highest-value extractions, each with proposed abstraction sketch and blast-radius estimate

#### Dependabot PRs (8 open as of 2026-05-28T18:32Z)

**Go:** #191 (golang.org/x/crypto), #193 (go-webauthn), #194 (golang.org/x/net)  
**npm:** #192 (axios), #195 (vite-plugin-vue-devtools), #196 (@vitejs/plugin-vue), #197 (vitest), #198 (vue-router)

#### Suggested Approach

1. **Batch Go PRs** (#191/#193/#194) together after single CI green run
2. **Batch npm PRs** (#192/#195/#196/#197/#198) separately after first batch merges
3. Review `security-scan.yml` first-run output (gitleaks + govulncheck + npm audit + pip-audit) before declaring audit bullet done
4. DRY scheduler refactor likely target: shared base scheduler pattern (commits expected: 1–2 for base, 3–4 for migration)

#### Why Captured

User-flagged coding queue survives session boundaries. Next session / Ralph cycle has unambiguous handoff: Phase 3b lands, then pivot to #163.
