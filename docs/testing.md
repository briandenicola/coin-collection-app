# Testing Strategy

This document is the canonical testing strategy for Ancient Coins. It explains what we test, what we intentionally do not test, and how contributors should add new tests across the Go API, Vue PWA, and Python agent.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

**Confidence over coverage.** We optimize for catching regressions in the paths that can break users, data integrity, or architectural rules, not for inflating a percentage. This follows Constitution Principle X and §21.6: tests exist to prove important behavior, and every new service method must have at least one unit test.

**Fast feedback first.** The cheapest checks run earliest: Go architecture tests, TypeScript checks, Ruff, and pytest/Vitest before any manual browser poking. This matches Principle IV and §17, which treat type/build parity and automated checks as merge gates.

**Test the contract, not the implementation.** Handler tests exercise HTTP status codes and JSON payloads, store tests assert state transitions, and agent tests validate schemas, routing helpers, and endpoint contracts instead of private internals. This is the practical testing expression of Principle VII (schema-driven contracts).

**Architecture tests are constitutional tests.** `src/api/architecture_test.go` is not "extra credit"; it enforces the Go layer rules from Principle I via Principle X. If those tests fail, the codebase is drifting away from the constitution even if feature tests still pass.

**End-to-end is rare and deliberate.** Cross-service and browser-wide tests are expensive, brittle, and especially weak for nondeterministic AI behavior. Per Principles III and VI, we instead test deterministic seams—HTTP contracts, repository behavior, parsing, schema validation, and orchestration helpers—and use production telemetry for model quality.

## 2. Test Surface Inventory

| Service | Layer | Tool | Location | Run command | What it tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Go API | Architecture | `go test` | `src/api/architecture_test.go` | `cd src/api && go test -v -run "TestNoDirectDatabaseImports|TestHandlersDoNotUseRawSQL|TestPackageImportMatrix" .` | 1 file / 3 tests enforcing DI-only database access, no raw SQL in handlers, and the package import matrix. |
| Go API | Unit + package-level behavior | `go test` | `src/api/{handlers,middleware,repository,services}/*_test.go` | `cd src/api && go test -v ./...` | 14 files / 115 tests: handlers 30, middleware 10, repository 23, services 52. Uses `httptest`, Gin test routers, and in-memory SQLite. |
| Go API | Dedicated integration / E2E | None today | None today | N/A | No cross-process integration suite or browser E2E suite exists. The closest coverage is handler HTTP tests and DB-backed repository/service tests. |
| Vue Web | Type checking | `vue-tsc` | `src/web/package.json`, `src/web/src/**` | `cd src/web && npx vue-tsc --noEmit` | CI gate for compile-time contract safety. Use it, but do not stop there. |
| Vue Web | Lint | ESLint | `src/web/package.json`, `src/web/eslint.config.*` if present | `cd src/web && npm run lint` | Static linting gate; the script exists even though the current CI workflow does not run it yet. |
| Vue Web | Unit / component / store / API tests | Vitest + Vue Test Utils | `src/web/src/**/__tests__/*` | `cd src/web && npm run test` | 8 files / 61 tests: API client 24, auth store 17, components 10, pages 3, design-token enforcement 7. Mocks browser APIs and the API client at the boundary. |
| Vue Web | Build parity | `vite` + `vue-tsc --build` | `src/web/package.json` | `cd src/web && npm run build` | Production build gate. This is stricter than `vue-tsc --noEmit`; nullable props and indexed access that pass locally can still fail here. |
| Vue Web | Browser E2E | None today | No `e2e/`, Playwright, or Cypress config found | N/A | No browser automation suite is configured today. |
| Python Agent | Lint | Ruff | `src/agent/app/`, `src/agent/tests/`, `src/agent/pyproject.toml` | `cd src/agent && ruff check app/ tests/` | Import order, correctness, and style rules for the deterministic Python surface. |
| Python Agent | Unit / contract tests | pytest | `src/agent/tests/test_*.py` | `cd src/agent && pytest tests/ -v` | 6 files / 35 tests covering FastAPI request validation, Pydantic models, retry logic, streaming helpers, availability parsing, and supervisor location context. |
| Python Agent | Static type checking | None configured today | `src/agent/pyproject.toml` | N/A | No `mypy` or `pyright` config is present; schema validation and pytest carry the current contract burden. |

Notes:
- `grep -rln "httptest\|testserver\|integration" src/api --include="*_test.go"` finds handler and middleware HTTP tests, but no dedicated integration package.
- `find src/web -iname '*playwright*' -o -iname '*cypress*' -o -path '*/e2e/*'` returns nothing.
- `pytest tests/ --collect-only -q` currently collects 35 agent tests across 6 files.

## 3. What we DON'T test

- We do **not** test SQLite, GORM, Gin, Vitest, FastAPI, or LangGraph themselves; we test our usage of them.
- We do **not** hit third-party services in automated tests. Anthropic, Ollama, SearXNG, NumisBids, and Pushover should be mocked or stubbed at the service boundary.
- We do **not** have a true browser E2E suite today. That is an honest gap, not hidden coverage.
- We do **not** attempt deterministic end-to-end assertions for LLM quality. For agent work we test input validation, parsing, retry behavior, routing helpers, and schema-shaped outputs.
- We do **not** add tests for trivial getters or thin pass-through code just to raise coverage numbers.

## 4. Test Pyramid Shape

```text
        E2E / browser-wide (none today; rare by design)
      Integration / cross-package / DB-backed flows
   Unit + contract tests per package, component, store, route, helper
Architecture tests and type/lint gates (cheapest, fastest, most structural)
```

For AI features, the top of the pyramid is intentionally shallow: we test deterministic orchestration and schema boundaries, then rely on runtime telemetry and human review for model quality.

## 5. Adding a New Test

### Go API

- Put the test beside the package under test as `*_test.go`; do not create a separate test tree.
- Follow the helper pattern in `src/api/services/auth_service_test.go` and `src/api/handlers/auth_handler_test.go`: small setup functions marked with `t.Helper()`.
- Use real in-memory SQLite (`glebarez/sqlite` + `gorm.Open(...":memory:"...)`) when repository behavior, transactions, or auth persistence matter.
- Use `httptest` + Gin routers for handler and middleware tests; assert status codes, JSON shape, and authorization behavior.
- Prefer table-driven tests for pure logic and parser-style code; `src/api/services/valuation_parser_test.go` is the model.
- Mock only true external boundaries (agent proxy, networked services, notifications). Prefer real repos/services inside the process.
- If a change touches the layer rules, extend `src/api/architecture_test.go` rather than burying the rule in prose.

### Vue Web

- Put tests under a nearby `__tests__/` folder, as in `src/web/src/components/__tests__/CollectionPagination.test.ts` or `src/web/src/stores/__tests__/auth.test.ts`.
- Test public behavior: rendered text, emitted events, store state, request payloads, or design-token guarantees—not component internals.
- Use Vitest plus Vue Test Utils for mounted components and `vi.mock()` for boundary modules such as `@/api/client`.
- Stub browser globals explicitly with `vi.stubGlobal`, as shown in `src/web/src/api/__tests__/client.test.ts` and `src/web/src/stores/__tests__/auth.test.ts`.
- Keep fixtures small and inline until multiple files need the same data.
- Source-scanning tests are acceptable for structural UI rules when rendering is unnecessary; see `src/web/src/__tests__/design-tokens.test.ts` and `src/web/src/pages/__tests__/CollectionPage.test.ts`.
- Always finish with `npm run test` and `npm run build`; the build catches stricter TypeScript failures than lighter local checks.

### Python Agent

- Put tests in `src/agent/tests/` as `test_*.py`.
- Use pytest fixtures to remove nondeterminism or waiting; `src/agent/tests/test_retry.py` patches retry delays to zero.
- Use FastAPI `TestClient` for route-level contracts, as in `src/agent/tests/test_api.py`.
- Stub LLM/model calls with `AsyncMock` or direct helper invocation rather than making live provider calls.
- Favor testing deterministic helpers directly—`parse_verdicts` in `src/agent/tests/test_availability.py` and `_build_coin_show_location_context` in `src/agent/tests/test_supervisor_coin_shows_location.py` are good examples.
- Assert structured outputs and schema defaults, not prose quality.
- Keep provider/network behavior at the boundary; real Anthropic/Ollama/SearXNG traffic does not belong in CI.

## 6. Running tests locally vs. CI

- Start from the task runner when possible: `task test` (Go), `task build` (Go + web build), `task test-agent`, and `task lint-agent` from [`../Taskfile.yml`](../Taskfile.yml).
- Frontend tests and lint currently live in npm scripts documented in [`../src/web/README.md`](../src/web/README.md): `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run type-check`.
- The current Quality Gate workflow lives at [`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml). Today it runs Go build/vet/architecture tests, Vue `vue-tsc --noEmit`, and Python Ruff + pytest.
- Local expectations are intentionally stricter than the current CI file in a few places: the Constitution still expects full `go test ./...` and `npm run build` before you call work done.
- Pre-commit hooks run only a subset locally; they are a convenience layer, not the definition of done. The full gate remains Constitution §17 plus the CI workflow.

## 7. Coverage philosophy

We do **not** gate PRs on a repo-wide coverage percentage. Coverage is a signal for blind spots, not a target to game.

Constitution §21.6 is the operative rule: **"every new service method has ≥ 1 unit test."** That pushes effort toward critical paths, invariants, and regressions instead of padding helpers with low-value tests. Use `go test ./... -cover` as a diagnostic when helpful, but do not treat a single percentage as proof of safety.
