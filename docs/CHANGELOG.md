## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Health endpoints** — `GET /health` and `GET /healthz` for container orchestration probes
- **API rate limiting** — General 120 req/min limit on all protected routes; 30 req/min on expensive write operations (image uploads, AI analysis, agent chat, imports)

- **golangci-lint config** — Go linter with errcheck, gocritic, misspell, bodyclose, staticcheck

- **Constitution enforcement** — Automated design token tests (border-radius, hex colors, font-size budgets)
- **Layer READMEs** — New README.md files for `src/api/`, `src/agent/`, replaced default Vite template in `src/web/`

### Changed

- **CoinDetailPage decomposition** — Reduced from 1130 to ~360 lines; extracted CoinTagsSection, CoinInfoGrid, CoinActionsPanel, CoinAIAnalysis, CoinListingStatus sub-components
- **Desktop layout** — Sticky image sidebar with 2-column dashboard; sticky action bar at top: 61px
- **Mobile/PWA** — Removed sticky positioning leak; single-column layout preserved
- **formatCurrency** — Shared utility in `@/utils/format.ts` adopted across all components (replaced 6 local copies)

### Fixed

- Store link rendering — Clickable link with "View Listing" fallback
- Docker TS build — Nullable props use `?? ''` coalescing for strict `vue-tsc --build`
- Actions + AI Analysis — Stacked full-width instead of squeezed side-by-side
- PWA mobile regression — Sticky CSS scoped to desktop-only `@media (min-width: 769px)`
- Sticky action bar gap — Aligned `top: 61px` with actual navbar height (60px content + 1px border)
- Removed stray `console.log` statements from `useCoinSearchChat.ts`
