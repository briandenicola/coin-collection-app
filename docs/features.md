## Detailed Feature Documentation

### Collection Management

The main collection page supports browsing your coins with filtering, search, and sorting:

- **Card Gallery** — Responsive card grid showing each coin's primary image with name, ruler, denomination, and category. Supports filtering by category (Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Modern), tag filter, and full-text search across all fields.
- **Face Toggle** — Switch between obverse and reverse images on coin cards (grid mode).
- **Sorting** — Sort by date added, date last updated, or current value (ascending or descending).
- **Swipe / Grid Toggle** — Switch between a swipeable card carousel (ideal for mobile/PWA) and a traditional grid layout. Default view preference is configurable in Settings.
- **Pagination** — Coins are loaded with pagination for large collections.
- **Category Colors** — Each category has a distinct color accent: purple for Roman, olive for Greek, red for Byzantine, and steel blue for Modern.
- **Bulk Select Mode** — Enter select mode to multi-select coins for batch operations (tagging, status changes, export). In PWA mode, a dedicated "Select" button appears in the header.

### Wish List

Track coins you'd like to acquire with an AI-powered search agent:

- **Add to Wish List** — When creating a coin, toggle the "Wishlist" flag. The coin appears in the dedicated Wish List view instead of the main collection.
- **AI Coin Search Agent** — Click "Find Coins" to open a chat drawer powered by the AI agent service (Anthropic Claude or Ollama, configurable in Admin). Describe the coins you're looking for (e.g., "Roman silver denarii of Julius Caesar under $500") and the agent searches the web for real listings and references. Results appear as cards with images, metadata, estimated prices, and source links — each with an "Add to Wishlist" button for one-click import.
- **Purchase** — Move a wishlist coin to your main collection when you acquire it. A styled purchase modal prompts for the purchase price and date, replacing the default browser confirm dialog.
- **Wish List Gallery** — A separate page showing only wishlist items with sorting support.
- **Coin Lookup Entry Point** — Launch Coin Lookup directly from the Wish List page to photograph a coin at a show and save the result as a wishlist item.
- **Availability Check** — Click "Check Availability" on the Wish List page to verify whether listed coins are still for sale. The system visits each coin's reference URL and uses HTTP status codes plus keyword heuristics (sold indicators, buy-now buttons) to determine listing status. Ambiguous results are escalated to the AI agent (Team 6) for deeper analysis. Results show as a summary banner (available / unavailable / unknown counts) and per-card status indicators (green dot, red "Unavailable" overlay, amber dot). Unavailable coins can be dismissed to clear the status.
- **Scheduled Checks** — Admins can enable automatic availability checks with a configurable start time and repeat interval (e.g., starting at 2:00 AM, repeating every 120 minutes). Run history with per-coin drill-down is available in the Admin Availability tab.

### Sold Coins

Track coins you've sold with profit/loss visibility:

- **Sell from Detail Page** — Click "Sell" on any collection coin's detail page. A styled modal prompts for the sale price and buyer name.
- **Profit / Loss Tracking** — Sold coins display the sale price, original cost basis, and calculated profit or loss (green for profit, red for loss).
- **Sold Gallery** — A dedicated gallery page showing all sold coins with their sale history, accessible from the navigation bar.
- **Stats Integration** — Sold coins are excluded from active collection totals while their sold values are tracked separately.

## Auction Tracking

Track auction lots from NumisBids through a complete bidding lifecycle:

- **Add Lots** — Manually add lots by pasting a NumisBids URL. The app scrapes the lot page for title, image, estimate, auction house, and sale name.
- **NumisBids Watchlist Sync** — Connect your NumisBids account (username and password stored per-user, validated on save) and sync your watchlist with one click. Each synced lot gets a full-resolution image scraped from the lot page.
- **Status Workflow** — Lots progress through statuses: Watching → Bidding → Won / Lost / Passed. Status transitions are validated (e.g., only Bidding lots can be marked Won).
- **Filtered Views** — Filter the auctions page by status. Counts for each status appear as badges on filter buttons.
- **Won → Collection** — When a lot is marked as Won, it is automatically converted into a coin in your collection (mapping title, category, auction house, sale date, bid price) and the edit page opens so you can add details. A manual "Add to Collection" button is also available.
- **AI Auction Search** — Ask the AI agent to search NumisBids for coins matching a description. The agent (Team 5) searches, fetches lot details, and formats results.
- **Credential Validation** — NumisBids credentials are validated against the live site before being saved. The Settings page shows connected/error/validating status indicators.

## Coin Details

Each coin can store:

- **Core fields** — Name, denomination, ruler/authority, era (`ancient`, `medieval`, `modern`), category, material, weight, diameter
- **Numismatic details** — Mint mark, obverse/reverse inscriptions, grade, RIC number, rarity rating
- **Financial data** — Purchase price, current value, acquisition date, dealer/source
- **Images** — Multiple image uploads per coin (obverse, reverse, edge, detail, full) with a gallery viewer. Supports file upload, paste-from-URL (fetched via server proxy), and direct camera capture in PWA mode.
- **Camera Capture (PWA)** — In PWA/mobile mode, a "Photo" button appears on upload sections letting you take coin photos directly with the rear camera. Available on the coin detail page and the add/edit form.
- **AI Analysis** — Markdown-formatted analysis from Ollama, stored with the coin (obverse and reverse analyzed separately)
- **Structured Catalog References** — Add and manage normalized references per coin (`catalog`, `volume`, `number`, optional invoice number, optional authority URI) directly in coin detail.
- **Activity Journal** — Timestamped log entries per coin (e.g., "cleaned", "sent to NGC for grading", "displayed at coin show"). Add and delete entries directly from the detail page.
- **Numista Catalog Lookup** — Search the Numista coin catalog directly from a coin's detail page. Results show thumbnails, title, issuer, and year range with links to the full Numista catalog entry.
- **Notes** — Free-text notes field

## AI Coin Analysis

Upload photos of a coin and click **Analyze with AI** to get an AI-powered numismatic analysis via Ollama. The analysis covers identification, obverse/reverse descriptions, inscriptions, condition assessment, historical context, and estimated market value. Obverse and reverse sides are analyzed separately with dedicated prompts. If accepted, the analysis is saved to the coin's record.

To enable AI analysis:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and pull a vision model: `ollama pull llava`
2. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
3. Configure the Ollama URL and model in **Admin → AI Configuration**

## AI Coin Search Agent

Chat with an AI agent that searches the web for coins matching your description. Powered by the multi-agent Python service (supports Anthropic Claude with built-in web search or Ollama with SearXNG), the agent returns structured coin suggestions with names, categories, materials, price estimates, source links, and candidate catalog references. Each suggestion can be added to your wishlist with one click.

Key features:

- **Streaming Responses** — Agent replies stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with a progressive text display and blinking cursor, so you see results as they arrive.
- **Real-time Status Indicators** — During agent processing, status indicators show which team and step is active (searching, fetching, formatting).
- **SSE Progress Events** — The agent streams structured progress events so the frontend can display step-by-step status updates.
- **Multi-team Architecture** — The agent uses specialized teams: coin search finds listings, coin shows finds upcoming events, portfolio review analyzes your collection, coin analysis examines uploaded images, coin grading estimates grades from photos, gap analysis identifies missing coins in your collection, photo guide critiques your coin photography, price trends analyzes market direction from auction history, and similar lots finds matching active auction listings.
- **Automatic Image Extraction** — When you add a coin to your wishlist, the system automatically extracts the listing's primary image using `og:image` meta tag scraping from the source page. Falls back to the agent-provided image URL if scraping finds nothing.
- **Candidate Catalog References** — Suggestions can include structured candidate references (`catalog`, `volume`, `number`, optional invoice number, optional authority `uri`) which are carried into wishlist coin creation.
- **Paste Image URL** — If automatic extraction misses an image, you can paste an image URL directly on the coin detail page to fetch and attach it.
- **Save Conversations** — Save search conversations for later reference. Saved chats appear in the Settings → Conversations tab where you can reopen or delete them.
- **Configurable Model & Prompt** — Admins can select the Claude model from a dropdown populated from the Anthropic API, and customize the agent's system prompt.

To enable the search agent:

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Configure it in **Admin → AI Configuration → Anthropic API Key**
3. Optionally select a different model or customize the agent prompt in Admin settings

## Coin Lookup

Use **Lookup Coin** from the main menu or Wish List page when evaluating a coin at a show. Capture or upload one or more photos of the coin or slab label. The app sends the images through the configured vision provider, extracts visible label text and coin fields, and looks for NGC Ancients certification numbers.

When an NGC cert is found, the result includes the normalized cert and an official NGC Ancients verification link in the form `https://www.ngccoin.com/certlookup/{compactCert}/NGCAncients/`. The lookup returns immediately after NGC extraction instead of waiting on catalog enrichment. When no NGC cert is found, the app uses configured Numista access to search for possible catalog matches and displays links to Numista entries.

Lookup results can be saved directly to the Wish List or Collection. The save flow creates the coin first, uploads the captured photos, then adds generated NGC or Numista structured references.

## Numista Catalog Integration

Look up coins in the [Numista](https://en.numista.com/) catalog directly from any coin's detail page or as a fallback from Coin Lookup when no NGC cert is detected. The search uses coin names, denominations, rulers, and extracted fields to find matching entries, displaying thumbnails and linking to full catalog pages.

To enable Numista lookup:

1. Get a free API key at [numista.com/api](https://en.numista.com/api/) (2,000 requests/month free)
2. Configure it in **Admin → System Settings → Numista API Key**

## Collection Statistics

The **Stats** page shows:

- **Summary cards** — Total coins, total value, average value, unique rulers
- **Category breakdown** — Distribution across Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Modern, and Other
- **Material distribution** — Breakdown by gold, silver, bronze, copper, and electrum
- **Grade distribution** — Bar chart showing coin counts by grade (VF, EF, AU, etc.) with a blue gradient
- **Value over time** — SVG line chart tracking total portfolio value and total invested over time, built from automatic snapshots recorded after every coin create, update, or delete
- **Top coins by value** — Ranked list of the most valuable coins in your collection
- **Era/Region Heat Map** — SVG-based heat map showing the distribution of your collection across time periods and geographic regions, highlighting concentrations and gaps at a glance. Available via the `/stats/distribution` endpoint.

## Image Text Extraction

Upload photos of store cards, certificates, or coin holder labels and extract text via OCR powered by Ollama. Useful for quickly capturing dealer information, grades, and reference numbers when adding coins.

## Social Features

## Authentication

The application supports multiple authentication methods for flexibility and security:

- **JWT + Refresh Tokens** — 15-minute access tokens with 30-day rolling refresh tokens. The frontend silently refreshes expired tokens so users stay logged in.
- **WebAuthn / Passkeys** — FIDO2 biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint). Register a passkey in Settings → Account, then use it to log in without a password. Requires HTTPS in production.
- **API Keys** — Generate API keys in Settings → Data for programmatic access. Keys use the `X-API-Key` header and are checked before JWT.

For a detailed walkthrough of each auth method, see the [Authentication Guide](authentication.md).

## External Tool Server

The External Tool Server exposes your collection to external AI clients (OpenWebUI, LibreChat, n8n, MCP-compatible clients) over a versioned HTTP API. External clients can query your collection, analyze statistics, and optionally propose updates through a secure two-phase commit flow.

**Key Features:**

- **Default-Off** — Admin must enable in System Settings. Disabled by default for security.
- **Scoped API Keys** — Each key has `read` (default) or `read,write` capability. Write must be explicitly chosen at key creation.
- **Two-Phase Writes** — External writes require `propose_update` (returns preview + token) followed by `commit_update` (with explicit confirm). No auto-writes.
- **Journaling** — External commits write audit entries with source `external_tool_server`, API key name, and changed fields.
- **Tenant Isolation** — Every operation is scoped to the API key owner. No cross-user access.
- **Per-Key Rate Limiting** — Stricter rate limits (50 req/min) prevent abuse from external clients.
- **Field Allowlist** — External writes restricted to `grade`, `currentValue`, `notes`, `tags`, `referenceText`, `referenceUrl`, `references`. Identity fields are rejected.
- **OpenAPI-First** — Served OpenAPI document at `/api/v1/tools/openapi.json` for client auto-import.
- **MCP Compatible** — Wrap the OpenAPI spec with `mcpo` to expose tools to MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

**Available Tools:**

- Read: `search_my_collection`, `get_coin`, `collection_summary`, `top_coins_by_value`
- Write: `propose_update`, `commit_update`

For setup instructions, security model, and client integration guides, see the [External Tool Server Guide](external-tool-server.md). The guide is organized by audience: administrators (enabling/managing the server), users (creating API keys and connecting clients), and developers (API reference and error handling).
