# Features

Detailed feature documentation for Ancient Coins. For a quick overview, see the [README](../README.md).

---

## Collection Management

The main collection page supports browsing your coins with filtering, search, and sorting:

- **Card Gallery** — Responsive card grid showing each coin's primary image with name, ruler, denomination, and category. Supports filtering by category (Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Modern) and full-text search across all fields.
- **Sorting** — Sort by date added, date last updated, or current value (ascending or descending).
- **Swipe / Grid Toggle** — Switch between a swipeable card carousel (ideal for mobile/PWA) and a traditional grid layout. Default view preference is configurable in Settings.
- **Pagination** — Coins are loaded with pagination for large collections.
- **Category Colors** — Each category has a distinct color accent: purple for Roman, olive for Greek, red for Byzantine, and steel blue for Modern.

## Wish List

Track coins you'd like to acquire with an AI-powered search agent:

- **Add to Wish List** — When creating a coin, toggle the "Wishlist" flag. The coin appears in the dedicated Wish List view instead of the main collection.
- **AI Coin Search Agent** — Click "Find Coins" to open a chat drawer powered by Anthropic Claude with web search. Describe the coins you're looking for (e.g., "Roman silver denarii of Julius Caesar under $500") and the agent searches the web for real listings and references. Results appear as cards with images, metadata, estimated prices, and source links — each with an "Add to Wishlist" button for one-click import.
- **Purchase** — Move a wishlist coin to your main collection when you acquire it. A styled purchase modal prompts for the purchase price and date, replacing the default browser confirm dialog.
- **Wish List Gallery** — A separate page showing only wishlist items with sorting support.

## Sold Coins

Track coins you've sold with profit/loss visibility:

- **Sell from Detail Page** — Click "Sell" on any collection coin's detail page. A styled modal prompts for the sale price and buyer name.
- **Profit / Loss Tracking** — Sold coins display the sale price, original cost basis, and calculated profit or loss (green for profit, red for loss).
- **Sold Gallery** — A dedicated gallery page showing all sold coins with their sale history, accessible from the navigation bar.
- **Stats Integration** — Sold coins are excluded from active collection totals while their sold values are tracked separately.

## Auction Tracking

Track auction lots from NumisBids through a complete bidding lifecycle:

- **Add Lots** — Manually add lots by pasting a NumisBids URL. The app scrapes the lot page for title, image, estimate, auction house, and sale name.
- **NumisBids Watchlist Sync** — Connect your NumisBids account (username and password stored per-user, validated on save) and sync your watchlist with one click. Each synced lot gets a full-resolution image scraped from the lot page.
- **Status Workflow** — Lots progress through statuses: Watching → Bidding → Won / Lost / Passed. Status transitions are validated (e.g., only Bidding lots can be marked Won).
- **Filtered Views** — Filter the auctions page by status. Counts for each status appear as badges on filter buttons.
- **Won → Collection** — When a lot is marked as Won, it is automatically converted into a coin in your collection (mapping title, category, auction house, sale date, bid price) and the edit page opens so you can add details. A manual "Add to Collection" button is also available.
- **AI Auction Search** — Ask the AI agent to search NumisBids for coins matching a description. The agent (Team 5) searches, fetches lot details, and formats results.
- **Credential Validation** — NumisBids credentials are validated against the live site before being saved. The Settings page shows connected/error/validating status indicators.

## Coin Details

Each coin can store:

- **Core fields** — Name, denomination, ruler/authority, year/era, category, material, weight, diameter
- **Numismatic details** — Mint mark, obverse/reverse inscriptions, grade, RIC number, rarity rating
- **Financial data** — Purchase price, current value, acquisition date, dealer/source
- **Images** — Multiple image uploads per coin (obverse, reverse, edge, detail, full) with a gallery viewer. Supports file upload, paste-from-URL (fetched via server proxy), and direct camera capture in PWA mode.
- **Camera Capture (PWA)** — In PWA/mobile mode, a "Photo" button appears on upload sections letting you take coin photos directly with the rear camera. Available on the coin detail page and the add/edit form.
- **AI Analysis** — Markdown-formatted analysis from Ollama, stored with the coin (obverse and reverse analyzed separately)
- **Activity Journal** — Timestamped log entries per coin (e.g., "cleaned", "sent to NGC for grading", "displayed at coin show"). Add and delete entries directly from the detail page.
- **Numista Catalog Lookup** — Search the Numista coin catalog directly from a coin's detail page. Results show thumbnails, title, issuer, and year range with links to the full Numista catalog entry.
- **Notes** — Free-text notes field

## AI Coin Analysis

Upload photos of a coin and click **Analyze with AI** to get an AI-powered numismatic analysis via Ollama. The analysis covers identification, obverse/reverse descriptions, inscriptions, condition assessment, historical context, and estimated market value. Obverse and reverse sides are analyzed separately with dedicated prompts. If accepted, the analysis is saved to the coin's record.

To enable AI analysis:

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and pull a vision model: `ollama pull llava`
2. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
3. Configure the Ollama URL and model in **Admin → AI Configuration**

## AI Coin Search Agent

Chat with an AI agent that searches the web for coins matching your description. Powered by Anthropic Claude with the web search tool, the agent returns structured coin suggestions with names, categories, materials, price estimates, and source links. Each suggestion can be added to your wishlist with one click.

Key features:

- **Streaming Responses** — Agent replies stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with a progressive text display and blinking cursor, so you see results as they arrive.
- **Real-time Status Indicators** — During agent processing, status indicators show which team and step is active (searching, fetching, formatting).
- **SSE Progress Events** — The agent streams structured progress events so the frontend can display step-by-step status updates.
- **Multi-team Architecture** — The agent uses specialized teams: coin search finds listings, coin shows finds upcoming events, portfolio review analyzes your collection, and coin analysis examines uploaded images.
- **Automatic Image Extraction** — When you add a coin to your wishlist, the system automatically extracts the listing's primary image using `og:image` meta tag scraping from the source page. Falls back to the agent-provided image URL if scraping finds nothing.
- **Paste Image URL** — If automatic extraction misses an image, you can paste an image URL directly on the coin detail page to fetch and attach it.
- **Save Conversations** — Save search conversations for later reference. Saved chats appear in the Settings → Conversations tab where you can reopen or delete them.
- **Configurable Model & Prompt** — Admins can select the Claude model from a dropdown populated from the Anthropic API, and customize the agent's system prompt.

To enable the search agent:

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Configure it in **Admin → AI Configuration → Anthropic API Key**
3. Optionally select a different model or customize the agent prompt in Admin settings

## Numista Catalog Integration

Look up coins in the [Numista](https://en.numista.com/) catalog directly from any coin's detail page. The search uses the coin's name, denomination, and ruler to find matching entries, displaying thumbnails and linking to full catalog pages.

To enable Numista lookup:

1. Get a free API key at [numista.com/api](https://en.numista.com/api/) (2,000 requests/month free)
2. Configure it in **Admin → System Settings → Numista API Key**

## Collection Statistics

The **Stats** page shows:

- **Summary cards** — Total coins, total value, average value, unique rulers
- **Category breakdown** — Distribution across Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Modern, and Other
- **Material distribution** — Breakdown by gold, silver, bronze, copper, and electrum
- **Grade distribution** — Bar chart showing coin counts by grade (VF, EF, AU, etc.) with a blue gradient
- **Value over time** — SVG line chart tracking total portfolio value and total invested over time, built from automatic snapshots recorded after every coin create, update, or delete
- **Top coins by value** — Ranked list of the most valuable coins in your collection

## Image Text Extraction

Upload photos of store cards, certificates, or coin holder labels and extract text via OCR powered by Ollama. Useful for quickly capturing dealer information, grades, and reference numbers when adding coins.

## Social Features

Follow other collectors and interact with their coin collections:

- **Follow / Unfollow** — Send follow requests to other public users. Requests start as `pending` until the other user accepts.
- **Accept / Block** — Review incoming follow requests and accept or block them. Blocked users cannot re-request unless explicitly unblocked.
- **Follower Gallery** — View an accepted follower's coin collection in a read-only gallery (pricing/value and AI analysis are hidden).
- **Comments & Star Ratings** — Leave comments and 1–5 star ratings on coins belonging to users you follow. Both the commenter and the coin owner can delete comments.
- **User Search & Discovery** — Search for other collectors by username. Only public users appear in search results.
- **Privacy Controls** — Toggle your profile between public and private. Setting your profile to private permanently removes all existing followers. Mark individual coins as private to hide them from followers.

For the full social API reference, see the [API Reference](api-reference.md#social).

## User Profiles

- **Avatar** — Upload a custom avatar image (stored in `uploads/avatars/`). The default is the Ed-Mar coin logo.
- **Bio** — Add a personal bio to your profile.
- **Public/Private Toggle** — Control whether your profile appears in search results and can receive follow requests.
- **Email** — Required for new registrations. Legacy users are prompted with a dismissible modal to add their email.

## User Settings

All authenticated users can access **Settings**, organized in a tabbed layout:

- **Account** — Change password (requires current password), register WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys for passwordless login, manage avatar and profile settings.
- **Appearance** — Switch between dark (museum) and light theme, set time zone, choose default gallery view (swipe or grid), and default sort order. Preferences persist across sessions.
- **Data** — Export your entire collection as JSON, import coins from a JSON file, and manage API keys for programmatic access. See the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md#import--export) for the full import file format.
- **Conversations** — View, reopen, or delete saved AI search agent conversations.
- **Help** — Beginner's guide to ancient coin collecting.

## Admin Settings

The first registered user is the admin. Admins can access **Admin** to manage:

- **Users** — View all registered users, delete accounts, and reset passwords.
- **AI Configuration** — Select your AI Provider: Anthropic (recommended) or Ollama. Configure Ollama (URL, vision model, timeout, analysis prompts), Anthropic (API key, model dropdown, editable agent prompt for the search agent), and SearXNG URL for Ollama web search.
- **System** — Set the application log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error) and configure the Numista API key for catalog lookups.
- **Logs** — View real-time application logs with level filtering, auto-refresh, and log export.

## Authentication

The application supports multiple authentication methods for flexibility and security:

- **JWT + Refresh Tokens** — 15-minute access tokens with 30-day rolling refresh tokens. The frontend silently refreshes expired tokens so users stay logged in.
- **WebAuthn / Passkeys** — FIDO2 biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint). Register a passkey in Settings → Account, then use it to log in without a password. Requires HTTPS in production.
- **API Keys** — Generate API keys in Settings → Data for programmatic access. Keys use the `X-API-Key` header and are checked before JWT.

For a detailed walkthrough of each auth method, see the [Authentication Guide](authentication.md).

## PWA Features

The app is a Progressive Web App installable on iOS, Android, and desktop:

- **Swipe Gallery** — Touch-based card carousel for browsing coins on mobile, with position persistence across navigation.
- **Pull-to-Refresh** — Pull down from the top of the gallery to refresh the coin list.
- **Camera Capture** — Take coin photos directly with the device camera from upload sections.
- **Hamburger Menu** — Gallery controls (filters, sort, view) in a compact popover menu.
- **Background Removal** — Remove image backgrounds in-place on the coin detail page using client-side ML.

For installation instructions and a full feature guide, see the [PWA Guide](pwa-guide.md).
