# Getting Started Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Ancient Coins for the first time, adding your first coin, and using the import/export features to manage your collection data.

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Start the Application

Run the app using one of the methods described in the [README](../README.md):

```sh
task run                    # development (Go + Vite)
docker compose up           # production (two containers)
```

### 2. Create Your Admin Account

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (development) or `http://localhost:8080` (Docker).

Click **Register** and create your account. The **first user** to register is automatically assigned the **admin** role. All subsequent users will be regular users.

### 3. Configure Settings (Admin)

As admin, click **Admin** in the navigation bar to configure:

- **AI Configuration** — Select your AI Provider: **Anthropic** (recommended) for Claude models with built-in web search, or **Ollama** for self-hosted models. Configure the provider-specific settings (API key, model, URL) and optionally customize analysis prompts. The Ollama URL is configured here (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- **System** — Set the log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and configure the Numista API key for catalog lookups.
- **Logs** — View real-time application logs with level filtering and auto-refresh

### 4. Start Adding Coins

Click **➕ Add Coin** from the collection page. Fill in as many fields as you like — only **Name** is required. Toggle **"Add to wishlist"** at the bottom if you don't own the coin yet.

After saving, you can upload images (obverse, reverse, detail) from the coin detail page.

## Import & Export

The import/export feature lets you back up your collection or migrate data between instances.

### Exporting Your Collection

1. Navigate to **Settings** (click the gear icon in the nav bar)
2. Under **Import / Export**, click **Export Collection**
3. Your browser will download a JSON file containing all your coins

The export includes every field for each coin in your collection. Image files are **not** included in the export — only the image metadata (file paths, types).

### Import File Format

The import endpoint accepts a **JSON array of coin objects**. Each object follows the same schema as the export. At minimum, each coin needs a `name` field. All other fields are optional.

#### Minimal Example

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Augustus Denarius"
  },
  {
    "name": "Nero Sestertius",
    "category": "Roman",
    "material": "Bronze"
  }
]
```

#### Full Example

```json

    "name": "Augustus Denarius - Capricorn Reverse",
    "category": "Roman",
    "denomination": "Denarius",

### Import Behavior

- The `id`, `userId`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields are **ignored** on import — new IDs are assigned and the coin is associated with your account.
- The `images` array is **ignored** — images must be uploaded separately after import.
- Each coin is imported independently. If one coin fails validation, the others still import.
- The response indicates how many coins were successfully imported:
  ```json
  { "message": "Import complete", "imported": 42 }
  ```
- **Duplicate detection is not performed** — importing the same file twice will create duplicate entries.

### Importing via the UI

1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Under **Import / Export**, click **Choose File** and select your JSON file
3. Click **Import Collection**
4. A success message will show how many coins were imported

### Importing via the API

You can also import directly via the REST API:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/user/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @my-coins.json
```

## AI Coin Analysis

Upload photos of a coin and click **Analyze with AI** on the coin detail page. The request is routed through the Python agent service using whichever AI provider is configured (Anthropic or Ollama). The AI will analyze the images and return a Markdown-formatted report covering:

- Coin identification (ruler, denomination, mint)
- Obverse and reverse design descriptions
- Inscription readings
- Condition assessment
- Historical context
- Estimated market value range

### Setup

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Pull a vision model:
   ```sh
   ollama pull llava
   ```
3. Start Ollama:
   ```sh
   ollama serve
   ```
4. In the app, go to **Admin → AI Configuration** and set the Ollama URL to point to your Ollama instance (default: `http://localhost:11434`)

### Custom Prompts

Admins can customize the AI analysis prompt in **Admin → AI Configuration → Analysis Prompt**. Leave blank to use the built-in numismatic analysis prompt. A custom prompt receives the coin images and should instruct the model on what analysis to perform.
