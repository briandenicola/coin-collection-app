# Security Principles

> The security posture we intentionally enforce across the Ancient Coins application. This is the stable controls catalog; the threat inventory lives in [threat-model.md](threat-model.md) and the operational playbook lives in [incident-response.md](incident-response.md).

## Scope and posture

Ancient Coins is a self-hosted, three-service application with a relatively small operator footprint but a broad attack surface: browser UI, Go API, Python agent, container build chain, and CI/CD. The June 2025 review documented 24 enumerated findings across backend, frontend, and supply chain surfaces (the legacy executive summary says 25); the highest-risk themes were browser trust boundaries, token exposure, input validation, and mutable build dependencies.

The project already starts from several strong defaults: layered architecture in the Go API, modern authentication primitives (JWT, refresh rotation, WebAuthn), minimal production containers, hashed API keys, lockfiles, and least-privilege CI permissions. This document captures the controls we expect every future change to preserve or strengthen.

## Principles we follow

1. **Single-ingress trust boundary** — the Vue SPA talks only to the Go API, and the Go API is the only HTTP client of the Python agent. This reduces duplicate auth, CORS, and rate-limit surfaces.
2. **Thin handlers, centralized data access** — request parsing stays in handlers and database access stays in repositories, which keeps validation and query hardening reviewable.
3. **Modern auth with revocation** — short-lived JWT access tokens, rotated refresh tokens, WebAuthn support, and hashed API keys are the baseline.
4. **Minimal production artifacts** — multi-stage Docker builds, a static Go binary, and small runtime images reduce attack surface.
5. **Secrets stay out of git history** — credentials belong in environment variables or ignored local files, never in tracked config.
6. **Generated or cached artifacts are not trusted by default** — Swagger examples, build output, and AI-generated content must be treated as potentially misleading or unsafe until validated.
7. **Least privilege by default** — CI permissions, runtime users, and future service credentials should be scoped to the minimum required capability.
8. **Security findings stay actionable** — tracked threats carry a severity, location, remediation path, and status in [threat-model.md](threat-model.md); operational handling lives in [incident-response.md](incident-response.md).

## Control areas mapped to the Constitution

The Constitution remains normative. This document translates its security expectations into a working controls catalog for day-to-day engineering decisions.

| Control area | What we enforce | Constitution cross-reference |
|---|---|---|
| Input validation | User-controlled query inputs must be parameterized or validated against explicit allowlists before they reach SQL, search parameters, or downstream services. | Principle XI (Security Hardening) |
| Output encoding and rendering | Untrusted HTML or Markdown rendered in the browser must be sanitized before `v-html` or equivalent sinks. | Principle XI |
| Secret handling | Secrets, API keys, and signing material must come from environment or secret stores; tracked files may only contain obviously fake examples. | Principle XI, Principle XV |
| Authentication and token policy | Access tokens stay short-lived, refresh tokens rotate on use, API keys stay hashed at rest, and WebAuthn ceremonies are origin-bound and time-bound. | Principle XII |
| Upload safety | File uploads validate extension and MIME/magic bytes, and body sizes stay capped to prevent memory exhaustion. | Principle XI |
| Abuse resistance | Auth endpoints are rate-limited and expensive operations should be reviewed for throttling or queueing. | Principle XI |
| Transport security | Production deployments use HTTPS for browser ↔ API traffic and for any WebAuthn origin. Tokens are never designed around plaintext transport assumptions. | Principle XI, Principle XII |
| Container hardening | Production containers should pin trusted base images and run as non-root users. | Principle XI, Principle XV |
| Supply chain integrity | GitHub Actions pin by SHA, lockfiles stay committed, dependency updates are reviewed, and security scanners are part of the delivery path. | Principle XV |
| Incident readiness | Security reports are acknowledged through [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), triaged with [incident-response.md](incident-response.md), and tracked against the live threat inventory. | Principle XI, Principle XV |

## Current implementation expectations

### Backend and API

- Prefer repository scopes and parameter binding over dynamic query fragments.
- Fail safely: log internal errors server-side and return generic client messages.
- Set multipart and JSON body caps for endpoints that accept user payloads.
- Keep WebAuthn origins explicit and ceremony sessions time-limited.

### Frontend and browser surface

- Treat any AI- or user-supplied rich text as untrusted until sanitized.
- Keep token-handling decisions aligned with the auth design in [authentication.md](authentication.md); any move between `localStorage`, headers, cookies, or passkeys requires ADR scrutiny.
- Avoid leaking sensitive identifiers through URLs, browser history, or cacheable responses where a request body or header would do.

### Supply chain and delivery

- Keep build inputs reproducible: pinned actions, reviewed dependency bumps, and explicit scanner config.
- Generated docs may contain fake examples; scanners should allowlist those precise artifacts rather than globally weakening rules.
- Treat weekly scans and dependency dashboards as maintenance inputs, not optional chores.

## How to add or change a principle

1. Decide whether the change is **normative** (Constitution-level) or **operational** (this document only).
2. If the rule changes project law, open an ADR under [docs/adr/](adr/) and follow the Constitution amendment workflow in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` §22 before editing the rule text.
3. Update this document with the control language engineers should follow in practice.
4. If the change introduces a new risk or retires an old one, update [threat-model.md](threat-model.md) in the same PR.
5. If the change affects incident handling, update [incident-response.md](incident-response.md) and [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) together.
