# AI Coin Search Agent

> Chat with an intelligent agent to discover coins matching your description across dealer sites, with real-time search results and structured suggestions.

## Overview

The AI Coin Search Agent is a multi-team LangGraph orchestrator that searches dealer websites, auction sites, and catalogs for coins matching your description. It returns structured results with images, metadata, prices, source links, and candidate catalog references that can be imported directly to your wishlist.

## Architecture

```
Vue Chat UI ──► Go API ──► Python Agent Service
  (streaming)   (proxy)    (multi-team pipeline)
```

The agent runs in a separate Python service (FastAPI + LangGraph) and streams responses back via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time visibility into the search process.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Search Method | Setup |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | Built-in `web_search_20250305` tool | API key required |
| **Ollama** | ReAct agent + SearXNG | Self-hosted Ollama + SearXNG |

**Recommendation**: Use Anthropic Claude for better search quality and built-in web search. Ollama requires additional setup but offers cost savings for self-hosted deployments.

## Configuration

### Admin Settings (`Admin → AI Configuration`)

#### Provider Selection
- **AI Provider** — Choose `anthropic` or `ollama`
- Both require valid configuration before any agent features work

#### Anthropic Setup
1. Get API key: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Paste into **Anthropic API Key** field
3. **Anthropic Model** — Auto-populated dropdown of available models
4. (Optional) Customize system prompt in **Coin Search Prompt**

#### Ollama Setup
1. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. Set **Ollama URL** (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
3. Set **Ollama Model** (e.g., `llama2`, `mistral`)
4. Set **SearXNG URL** for web search (default: `http://localhost:8888`)
5. Set timeout and custom prompts as needed

## Quality & Best Practices

### Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific** — "Roman denarii of Julius Caesar" is better than "old Roman coins"
2. **Include Context** — "Silver coins under $500" is more useful than "cheap coins"
3. **Use Known Terms** — Ruler names, denominations, and eras help narrow search
4. **Check Results** — Review sources; verify dealer reputation if purchasing

### Search Limitations

- Search quality depends on dealer website indexing
- Prices may be outdated (listings change daily)
- Some rare coins may not have public listings
- Results are only as good as the search engine can find

## API Reference

```
POST   /api/agent/chat              # Send message to agent (SSE stream)

```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Agent service unavailable" | Ensure Python agent is running; check `AGENT_SERVICE_URL` |
| Logs show "Internal service credential is not configured" | Set the same `AGENT_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` in both the Go API and Python agent containers, then recreate both containers |
| Chat freezes | Increase timeout in admin settings or try again |
| No search results | Try simpler description; check provider configuration |
| Wrong results | Refine description; provide more context (era, material, etc.) |
| API key error | Verify API key in Admin → AI Configuration |
