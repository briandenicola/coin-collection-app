# Wish List

> Track coins you'd like to acquire, search for real listings via AI, verify availability, and convert purchases to your collection.

## Overview

The Wish List helps collectors systematically track and acquire coins. It integrates AI-powered dealer discovery, automatic availability checking, and seamless conversion to owned coins when acquired.

## Core Functionality

### Creating Wishlist Coins

#### Manual Entry
1. Create a new coin and toggle the **Wishlist** flag
2. Coin appears in the Wish List view instead of main collection
3. Add images, notes, and target price information

#### AI Discovery
1. Navigate to **Wish List → Find Coins**
2. Open the AI agent chat drawer
3. Describe coins you're looking for (e.g., "Roman silver denarii of Julius Caesar under $500")
4. Agent searches dealer sites and returns structured suggestions
5. Each result shows: image, metadata, estimated price, source link
6. Click **Add to Wishlist** to import with one click

#### Coin Lookup
1. Navigate to **Wish List → Lookup Coin**
2. Take or upload photos of a coin or certification slab
3. Review extracted details, NGC verification links, or Numista fallback matches
4. Click **Add to Wishlist** to create a wishlist coin with captured photos and structured references

### Viewing Your Wish List

- **Dedicated Gallery** — Separate view from main collection
- **Same Filters/Sort** — Full-text search, category filtering, sorting by price/date
- **Status Indicators** — Show if coin is actively listed, unavailable, or unknown
- **Price Tracking** — Note current asking prices and compare over time
- **Lookup Saves** — Coins saved from Coin Lookup include captured photos and generated NGC or Numista references

## Availability Checking

### Manual Availability Check

1. Click **Check Availability** on the Wish List page
2. System visits each coin's source URL
3. Uses HTTP status codes and keyword heuristics (e.g., "sold", "buy now" buttons)
4. Returns status per coin: Available, Unavailable, or Unknown

### Check Results

**Summary Banner** shows:
- Available count (green)
- Unavailable count (red)
- Unknown count (gray)

**Per-Card Indicators:**
- ✅ **Green dot** — Listing is active and available
- ❌ **Red "Unavailable"** — Listing is sold or removed
- ⚠️ **Amber dot** — Status unknown; AI agent may provide additional analysis

### Automatic Availability Checks

**Admin Configuration** (`Admin → Availability Checks`):
- **Enable/Disable** — Turn automatic checks on/off
- **Schedule** — Daily start time (e.g., 2:00 AM)
- **Repeat Interval** — Minutes between checks (e.g., every 120 minutes)
- **Run History** — View past checks with per-coin drill-down
  - URL checked
  - Status (Available/Unavailable/Unknown)
  - Reason (HTTP code, keyword match, AI analysis)
  - Whether AI agent was used for ambiguous results

### Dismissing Results

- Click **Dismiss** on unavailable coins to clear the status indicator
- Dismissed coins remain in wishlist but status is hidden

## Purchase Workflow

### Move to Collection

1. Find the coin you've acquired in your Wish List
2. Click **Purchase** or **Move to Collection**
3. A styled modal prompts for:
   - **Purchase Price** — Amount paid
   - **Purchase Date** — When acquired
   - Optional: **Dealer/Source**

4. Click **Confirm**
5. Coin moves to main collection with purchase data
6. Edit page opens to add images, detailed notes, and provenance

## AI Coin Search Agent

### Using the Agent

1. Click **Find Coins** from the Wish List page
2. Chat drawer opens with AI agent
3. Describe what you're looking for:
   - "Roman silver coins of Julius Caesar"
   - "Greek silver tetradrachms from Athens"
   - "Byzantine gold coins from the 6th century"

### Agent Workflow

The agent uses a multi-team pipeline:

1. **Search Team** — Searches dealer sites, auction listings, and catalogs
2. **Fetch Team** — Retrieves detailed information (images, specs, prices)
3. **Format Team** — Structures results with coin metadata
4. **Candidate References** — Includes structured catalog references (RIC, RPC, Numista IDs)

### Agent Responses

Each result includes:
- **Image** — Fetched from listing (or auto-extracted via og:image meta tag)
- **Name & Metadata** — Denomination, ruler, era, category
- **Material** — Gold, silver, bronze, etc.
- **Estimated Price** — Dealer asking price or market estimate
- **Source Links** — Direct link to the listing
- **Catalog References** — Structured references (catalog, volume, number, URI)
- **Add to Wishlist** — One-click import with all metadata

### Streaming Responses

- Responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Progressive text display with status indicators
- See which agent team is active (searching, fetching, formatting)

## Auto-Image Extraction

When importing a wishlist coin from search results:

1. System attempts to extract primary image using `og:image` meta tag
2. Falls back to agent-provided image URL if meta tag scraping fails
3. Image is downloaded and attached to the coin
4. Falls back to manual entry if auto-extraction fails

### Manual Image Entry

If auto-extraction misses an image:
1. Go to the coin detail page
2. Click **Paste Image URL** in the Images section
3. Provide the image URL
4. System downloads and attaches the image

## Saved Conversations

- **Save Chat** — Save search conversations for later reference
- **Access Saved Chats** — `Settings → Conversations`
- **Reopen Chats** — Click to continue previous conversation
- **Delete Chats** — Remove conversations you no longer need

## Wish List Statistics

- **Count** — Total coins in wish list
- **Total Estimated Cost** — Sum of estimated prices (if available)
- **Availability Status** — % available / unavailable / unknown
- **Most Expensive** — Highest-priced wishlist coin

## Configuration

### User Preferences
- None — Wish List uses same settings as main collection (view, sort, filters)

### Admin Settings (`Admin → AI Configuration`)
- **AI Provider** — Choose Anthropic Claude or Ollama
- **Web Search** — Anthropic has built-in web search; Ollama requires SearXNG
- **Search Agent Prompt** — Customize the agent's system prompt
